Possession of a national passport creates a prima facie presumption that the holder is a national of the country of issue, unless the passport itself states otherwise,3 which does not in this case.\nThere was no evidence before the panel to suggest that the passport is fraudulent or obtained fraudulently.\nEthnicity\nThe claimant, in response to question 9 of her Personal Information Form (PIF), declared that she was \"Half Roma\". She alleged in her narrative4 that her father was a Rom and \" I am not visible and as such without seeing my father nobody knew that I had a Roma parent.\"\nHowever, at the hearing she acknowledged that she was not a Rom. Asked to explain why she misled the Division and declared5 in her PIF on May 13, 2002 that, \"I declare that the information contained herein is true and correct to the best of my\nknowledge and belief.\" She explained that it was the suggestion of the interpreter who worked for the former counsel and she was not comfortable with it. The panel does not accept her explanation regarding misleading the panel as persuasive, bearing in mind that at the beginning of the hearing she failed to amend her PIF with respect to her ethnicity and the narrative, when she was provided the opportunity. Asked to explain why she failed to make the amendment, she replied that it was the counsel's fault. The panel does not accept her explanation for misleading the Division regarding her ethnicity as reasonable.\nAdditionally, the claimant at the interview of the Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) on February 12, 026 also based her refugee claim on her ethnic origin stating that, \" I am a Roma\". The claimant testified at the hearing that her allegation was \"not true\".\nIn view of the above, the panel finds that the claimant is not a Rom and is not perceived as such.\nAllegations & Assessment of Credibility\nIn adducing and assessing the claimant's allegation the panel was mindful of the Chairperson's guidelines, Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related persecution. With respect to assessing the credibility of the claimant's oral evidence regarding her alleged boyfriend XXXXX, a member of the Mafia, whom she met in XXXXX 2001 and who befriended the claimant, forced her to have oral sex and threatened her in order to find information from her about a family she allegedly helped escape the Mafia in XXXXX 2000, the panel is guided by the Federal Court decision in Orelien7 which states that \"One cannot be satisfied that the evidence is credible or trustworthy, unless satisfied that it is probably so.\"\nIn this case, the claimant's oral evidence in general was not straightforward, and was implausible and inconsistent. Additionally, numerous omissions existed between her oral testimony, the first narrative, the second narrative8 and the CIC notes. Her explanations in most cases were not persuasive, reasonable or plausible and created further omissions or inconsistencies.\nWith respect to the assessment of credibility related to the omissions, the Federal Court in Dan-Ash9 stated: \"...An important indicator of credibility is the consistency with which a witness has told a particular story.\"\nThe panel assigns more weight to the CIC report written by the CIC officer in line of duty who has no interest in the outcome of the case and is subject to the CIC policies and guidelines.\nFurther, the panel was also mindful of the Federal Court Trial Division in Sung10 which states that contradictions are not exclusive factual sources on which the presumption of truth may be rebutted. It further states that: \"A tribunal may also conclude that a claimant's evidence is implausible, or improbable, or dubious, or untenable, or unreliable, or absurd, or unconvincing.\"\nToo many inconsistencies, omissions and implausibilities existed in the claimant's evidence to mention. The following includes some examples regarding the most significant allegation with respect to the alleged boyfriend, a Mafioso, the source of the claimant's fear, if she were to return to Hungary.\nWith respect to XXXXX, the claimant in her first narrative11 alleged that:\n...We dated for a while before I felt comfortable to introduce him to my mother. I took him home for a Sunday lunch. In my mother's place there is a picture of my father on top of the cupboard. After we left XXXXX was very upset and he was shouting at me that he did not know that I was a filthy Gypsy. I did not want to see him after that, but he continued to harass me over the phone.\nIn early XXXXX 2001 I was on my home from the grocery store when I saw XXXXX standing in front of my building. I approached the building and wanted to go in when he grabbed me and started shouting at me again. He told me that he did not truly want to date me, and he only did it because he was paid to do so. He was paid to get information about the XXXXX family, whom I helped escape in XXXXX of 2000.\n...During our last meeting XXXXX was trying to get information about the XXXXX family, but I would not give him any. He became very upset, called me racially demanding names and hit me...\n...He also came back to my building at least 5 times. I am not sure if he was more upset that I would not give him information or that he was dating a woman for a period of time who was half Roma.\nHowever, the account of the alleged incidents noted above were significantly different in her second narrative12 indicating that:\nOn the XXXXX we went to my mother's place where my mom showed him the family photos including the ones about my childhood...On our way home his entire behaviour changed; he stared shouting at me saying; \"What the hell did you have to take me to your family for? I am not interested in your goddamn family!\" \"You are just a cheap slut just like the others.\" \"You thought I wanted to marry you?\" \"Why do you think I get together with you?\" \"they asked me to get everything you know about the XXXXX family.\nShe testified that XXXXX did not talk to her about the XXXXX family prior to the XXXXX incident.\nIn the second narrative she further alleged that after XXXXX, XXXXX harassed her 2-3 times a week on the phone. In XXXXX he grabbed the claimant by her neck in the elevator of her apartment building and threatened her. He showed up again in front of her apartment on XXXXX, 2001 and to talked to the claimant. They talked inside of her building [lobby]. He left after a neighbour approached while threatening her. The telephone harassment continued. She avoided him on XXXXX, 2001 and XXXXX, 2001 after noticing him in front of her building.\nShe alleged that on XXXXX, 2001, the claimant answered her door and found XXXXX at her apartment door. He forced himself into the apartment and \"firmly clasped his hands over my mouth\". He dragged the claimant into the bedroom, beat her and forced her to perform oral sex. He threatened her with her life. The claimant alleged that all of his actions toward her were because he wanted information about the XXXXX family.\nThe claimant was asked to explain why the allegations of beating and forced sexual act of XXXXX incident were omitted from the first narrative, she replied that the \"lady\" [interpreter] told her that was enough and she could elaborate on it at the hearing. Asked if she told the \"lady\" about the beating and the sexual act she replied \"yes\" and explained that the interpreter referring to the sexual incident, wrote on several occasions that the claimant was assaulted and harassed. The claimant told her \"let's write more\" but the \"lady\" told the claimant that they would elaborate later.\nThe panel does not accept any of her explanations stated in this respect as reasonable considering that the interpreter allegedly falsified the fact that the claimant was a Rom in order to boost her refugee claim. Thus the interpreter's action to minimize the beating and sexual incidents as assaults and harassment, as alleged by the claimant, is inconsistent with the interpreter's intent to boost the claimant's claim. It is reasonable to expect that she would have included the claimant's allegations of forced sexual act to further strengthen her story, rather than as the claimant alleged, the interpreter told the claimant that it was enough and \"good this way\".\nWhen the claimant was asked to explain the omission of the other alleged incidents of the second narrative from the first narrative, she replied that the interpreter shortened her allegations by referring to them as harassment. The claimant wanted to change counsel so that she could get a detailed narrative. The panel does not accept her explanation as reasonable. The interpreter has no interest in the outcome of the refugee claim. Furthermore, the claimant admitted at the hearing that the allegation of her Roma ethnicity was false. In her first narrative she alleged that XXXXX behaviour towards her changed after finding out she was half Rom. Thus, since the base of her allegation is false, the panel finds that the ensuing incidents are also false. Furthermore, if the panel was to accept that XXXXX existed, which we do not, the panel finds it implausible that he would on the balance of probabilities reveal to the claimant his intention when he was paid to date her, win her confidence in order to obtain information about the XXXXX family. His actions in this respect were inconsistent with his motives.\nFurthermore, the panel finds the claimant's evidence that he only stalked her near her residence at night and made harassing calls to her residence only because he worked as a XXXXX XXXXX in day time, inconsistent with her evidence that he first met her at her work place, pretending he was interested in purchasing XXXXX. The claimant's explanation that he did not harass or visit her at her work place because that was the place of employment and she visited clients at home is not persuasive.\nAdditionally, the claimant was asked to explain why the Mafia would come looking for her in XXXXX 2001 when her evidence revealed that she helped the XXXXX family's escape in XXXXX 2000, she replied that XXXXX told her that he had waited 14 months because he could not find her. The panel does not accept her explanation as persuasive in view of her evidence that the Mafia became aware of her in 2000.\nMoreover, the claimant was asked to explain the omission of all the allegations regarding XXXXX i.e. the harassment and forced sexual act from the CIC notes, she replied that the information at the CIC was what the interpreter had said and she did not know. The panel does not accept her explanation as persuasive considering that in the CIC notes the claimant had knowingly falsely based her refugee claim on her Roma ethnicity, differential treatment in securing employment and inability to obtain government subsidized housing although her financial situation warranted it. It is reasonable to expect that she would have made some reference to all these alleged incidents.\nThe panel is also mindful of the Court's decision in Basseghi,13 which stated:\nIt is not incorrect to say that answers given in a PIF should be brief, but it is incorrect to say that answers should not be complete with all the related facts. It is not enough for [the claimant] to say what he said in oral testimony was an elaboration. All relevant and important facts should be included in one's PIF. The oral evidence should go on to explain the information contained in the PIF.\nThe panel finds the cumulative effect of all the above omissions between the narratives and the CIC notes and the inconsistencies between the two narratives regarding the same incidents and implausibilities leads the panel to find the claimant's evidence regarding XXXXX and the alleged incidents are not credible.\nIn the case of Sheikh,14 the Federal Court held, \"... a general finding of a lack of credibility on the part of the applicant may conceivably extend to all relevant evidence emanating from his testimony.\"\nThe gravity of the above inconsistencies, omissions and implausibilities, in the absence of a reasonable explanation, is such that leads the panel to find that this lack of credibility extends to all relevant evidence emanating from the claimant and renders her entire testimony not credible.\nThe panel assigns no probative value to the claimant's documents in view of a lack of credibility finding,15 including the Clinical Consultation report16 from J. Weinberg,\nM.A., social worker. The report was compiled after the claimant's single visit on March 13, 2003, approximately one month before the hearing and approximately two and a half months after the claimant signed the second narrative. The claimant testified that her counsel recommended her to see the social worker. Asked if the reason for her visit was to get the social worker's report so as to corroborate her allegations, she replied \"yes\". The claimant testified that the social worker was provided a copy of her narrative. Appropriate weight was assigned to the social worker's assessment of the claimant's clinical impressions. However, the claimant and her narrative were the source of the cause of her problem. The social worker is not the trier of fact; she is merely reporting what the claimant reported to her. The panel finds, in the circumstances of this case, the social worker's report to be self-serving.\nAfter careful consideration of the totality of the evidence, the panel finds, on the balance of probabilities, the claimant had fabricated the allegations in the narrative.\nDecision\nIn view of the foregoing, given that the definition is forward-looking, the panel finds that there is insufficient \"objective basis\" to support the claimant's \"subjective fear\" and there is \"no reasonable chance\" that she would face persecution for any of the grounds stated in the Convention refugee definition and in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, if she were to return to Hungary.\nFurthermore, there is no serious possibility that the claimant would face a risk to her life or would be subjected to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if she were to return to Hungary.\nAdditionally, substantial grounds do not exist to believe that she would be subjected to a danger of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture if she were to return to Hungary.\nFor these reasons, the Refugee Protection Division determines that the claimant XXXXX XXXXX is not a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. The panel rejects her claim for refugee protection.\n\"F. Mortazavi\"\nF.

They also allege that they are \"persons in need of protection,\" under section 97(1)2 of the Act.\nThe father, who is the principal applicant, testified during the hearing, stating that he had been born in Israel and had lived there for his whole life. Given the almost daily campaign of suicide attacks in his country, he fears for his family's life and is seeking Canada's protection because of said attacks.\nThe claimant described various situations: relatives miraculously escaping suicide attacks, the claimant taking his children out of school, and his wife witnessing a suicide attack. The claimant talked about other people, but he was always afraid. All Israeli citizens live with this fear, but it does not qualify as one of the five grounds pursuant to the Convention. It is a situation of generalized risk which all Israeli citizens face. The State is not obligated to achieve results with regard to the protection of its citizens. The State of Israel cannot protect each of its citizens at all times, but it cannot be said that it is not using all the means at its disposal to protect them against what the claimant fears most, that is suicide attacks. According to documentary evidence, Israel is providing adequate protection for its citizens.\nThe panel concludes that there are no grounds for persecution under section 96 of the Act. In addition, the claimants did not prove that they personally would be subject to a danger of torture, a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the event of their return to Israel, under section 97 of the Act. The claimants have not justified their claims.\nThe panel knows that the situation is not good in Israel and it greatly sympathizes with the claimants because life can be very difficult in their country. The panel suggested that the claimants look at other options with their counsel.\nConsequently, the panel concludes that the claimants, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXX, do not have Convention refugee status, under section 96 of the Act. Also, the panel concludes that said XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXX do not have the status of \"persons in need of protection,\" pursuant to section 97(1) of the Act. Their refugee claim is denied.\nRoger Houde\nRoger Houde\nJanuary 30, 2004\nDate\n\/jcbo\/ag\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC (2001), C-27, reads in part as follows:\n96. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,\n(a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or\n(b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.\n2 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC (2001), C-27, reads in part as follows:\n97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\n(a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or\n(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\n(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of that country,\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country;\n(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\n(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - ORAL DECISION - RACE - RELIGION - POLITICAL OPINION - GENERALIZED RISK - NEXUS - STATE PROTECTION - MALE - FEMALE - NEGATIVE - ISRAEL\n---------------\n---------------\n---------------\n---------------\nNo. dossier SPR \/ RPD file #: MA3-01325\nMA3-01326 MA3-01327 MA3-01328\n3\n",

XXXXXX XXXXXXXX (the claimant) to re-open the claimant's refugee claim. The claim was originally abandoned1 and an application to re-open was denied by Member Jackson on August 19, 2003.e. This is a second application to re-open this claim, based on additional evidence filed by the claimant through his counsel.\nThis application was deemed made pursuant to Rules 55 and 44 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules.2 The Minister's representative was served with the deemed application and supporting materials and has made no representation in regard to the application. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD), pursuant to its powers under Rule 68, disposed of this application without a hearing.\nTHE ISSUE\nThe RPD has no jurisdiction to re-open a hearing of a Convention refugee claim except in circumstances where a breach of natural justice has occurred.3 The only issue to be determined in this application is whether there was a failure to observe a principle of natural justice in denying the claimant's motion to re-open.\nBACKGROUND\nThe following is a chronology of events pertaining to this claim:\n1. The claimant is an alleged citizen of Sri Lanka who entered Canada on September 16, 2002. He made a refugee claim at the Vancouver International Airport and the claim was referred to the Board on the same day. The claimant failed to file a completed Personal Information Form (PIF) at the Board within 28 days and the claimant was sent a Notice to Appear to \"show cause\" at a hearing on November 19, 2002. The claimant failed to appear and the claim was declared abandoned on November 19, 2002. There was no counsel of record at the time of the abandonment proceeding.\n2. The claimant filed an application to re-open which was dismissed by Member Jackson on August 19, 2003. Member Jackson concluded, after considering all the evidence, including all the materials filed by Canada Immigration and the whole of the record in the matter (same paragraph continues)that there had been no failure to observe a principle of natural justice in this case and therefore that the RPD had no jurisdiction to re-open the hearing into the claimant's claim to be a Convention refugee.\n3. Counsel filed an application to re-instate [sic] the claim, by which I have interpreted he is actually filing an application to re-open for a second time, since the claimant did not withdraw his original claim. He argues, inter alia that the IRB does have jurisdiction to re-open in matters other than a violation of the principal of natural justice, and he filed further evidence of the claimant's identity and information respecting the claimant's Montreal claim, filed under a different name.\nANALYSIS AND FINDINGS\nAfter having reviewed the whole record and the materials submitted by counsel, I conclude that there is no violation of the rules of natural justice in this case. While counsel raises an interesting theoretical argument, I do not accept it is correct in law.\nThe Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)4 makes no reference to the RPD having jurisdiction to re-open an abandoned claim. The RPD Rules cannot grant a power that is not rooted in the Act or the common law. At common law the RPD has the jurisdiction to re-open a claim for violations of natural justice. Rule 55 codifies this power. Therefore, counsel's argument fails because he has not presented a persuasive argument that the RPD has the power to consider the merits of the application. I have assumed that the \"merits\" of this application are founded on the explanation offered by the claimant for his misrepresentations and his failure to appear for the show cause hearing, as required.\nThe claimant has conceded that there was no failure on the part of the RPD to observe the rules of natural justice. What the claimant is asking me to do, is to review the decision of Member Jackson which I have no jurisdiction to do unless there has been a breach of natural justice. The arguments of counsel have not persuaded me otherwise.\nI find no violation of the principles of natural justice on the part of the Refugee Protection Division in regard to the decision denying the application to re-open on August 19, 2003.\nI am satisfied that the procedural requirements of section 169 of IRPA and Rule 58(2), and Rule 55 of the RPD Rules were properly considered by the Refugee Protection Division in refusing to re-open this claim.\nCONCLUSION AND DECISION\nAfter considering the deemed application, the decision of Member Jackson, and the whole of the record in this matter, I conclude that there has been no failure to observe a principle of natural justice in this case and therefore the Refugee Division has no jurisdiction to re-open the hearing into the claimant's claim to be a Convention refugee. Accordingly, the application is denied.\n\"Paulah Dauns\"\nPaulah Dauns\nMarch 12, 2004\nDate\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - APPLICATION - REOPENING - ABANDONMENT - JURISDICTION - STATUTORY INTERPRETATION - IMMIGARTION AND REFUGEE PROTECTION ACT - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION RULES - NATURAL JUSTICE - MALE - DISMISSED - SRI LANKA\n1 Pursuant to s.341 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, a claim declared to be abandoned under the Immigration Act is deemed to be a claim abandoned under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n2 Refugee Protection Division Rules, SOR\/2002-228\n3 RPD Rule 55(4) has codified this long established common law rule (Longia v.

The claimant further claims that he would be at risk of torture or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Angola, or at risk of losing his life.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant asserts that his father was born in Cabinda, a province that has been seeking independence from Angola since 1975. On XXXXXXX 24, 2001, the claimant asserts that his father participated in a march in Cabinda in support of FLEC, an organization trying to have independence for the state from Angola.\nThe claimant asserts that during this march, the police ordered people to stop and the organizers and supporters ignored this order. There was an altercation between the police and the supporters. The police opened fire at the participants and more than 60 people were killed. The claimant asserts that his father was killed at this time.\nThe claimant was in the capital of Angola, Luanda, at the time of this incident. The claimant asserts that he and members of his family, went to the police to inquire about the father's fate and the police refused to give them information. The claimant asserts that the family never got information about the death and never saw the father's body.\nThe claimant further asserts that almost a week later on XXXXX, 2001, the police came to the family home in Luanda. The claimant was at school. His mother was at work and only his older brother was present. The police took his older brother and a note was left by the police indicating that the mother and the claimant should report to the police station.\nThe claimant asserts that the claimant's mother did go to the police station to ask about this report and was told that the claimant should surrender himself to the authorities. The claimant asserts that the police gave no reasons for wanting the claimant to report and he further asserts that the police refused to provide information about the brother's whereabouts. Fearing for his safety, the claimant then made a decision not to report to the police and instead to leave Angola. He went to a local church where he knew the minister. He was helped to remain there for five weeks until his trip to Canada was arranged as part of a church delegation going to the United States.\nThe claimant asserts that he was using a Portuguese passport that was not his to effect his travel from Angola to the United States as part of this delegation and he asserts that he travelled from Angola on XXXXX, 2001 via South Africa, Madrid, Zurich, to the United States, and that he was assisted to come to Canada on May 12, 2001 where he made his refugee claim on arrival.\nThe claimant fears the authorities in Angola. He believes that he is being sought as a consequence of his father's political opinion, being involved in pressing for the separation of Cabinda from Angola, and he believes that he would be tortured in detention or suffer other cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in detention and that there is no internal flight alternative available to him.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\nThe claimant presented a Portuguese passport, which he used to travel from Angola, which does not bear his name and the photograph is not a photograph of the claimant. The panel finds that this document was not legally issued to the claimant.\nIn support of his personal identity, the claimant presented a copy of his national identity card, the original of which was retained by Immigration and which was forwarded by Immigration to the panel prior to the hearing. The panel therefore had the opportunity to view the original identity card, which indicates the claimant's name and his family, his signature, and his photograph and it indicates that his residence is Luanda when he was born.\nThe panel therefore accepts this as a credible document establishing the claimant's personal identity as having been born in Angola and therefore is sufficient evidence to establish that he is a citizen of Angola.\nCredibility\nThe panel has found that the claimant has provided insufficient credible evidence to establish his claim for the following reasons.\nThere were a number of internal inconsistencies in the claimant's evidence, between the Personal Information Form (PIF) and the Port of Entry (POE) notes. In attempting to explain these inconsistencies, the panel finds the claimant's explanations to be unsatisfactory or not credible on the following issues.\nAs outlined in the allegations, the claimant's PIF is basing his claim on the alleged death of his father and the alleged disappearance of his brother. In Exhibit M-1, the POE notes and the form that was completed at the Port of Entry by the Immigration Officer indicates that claimant's basis of his fear is that he fears performing his military service in a country at war.\nThe claimant was asked to explain why in his POE notes he made no mention of the death of his father or the disappearance of his brother. In his response to these questions, the claimant gave internally contradictory evidence. The form completed at the POE is written in French. The claimant does not understand English or French and he asserts he was attempting to\ncomplete this form without the assistance of an interpreter. He pointed out in the hearing that significant portions of the first page were completed in his own handwriting and that the bottom half of the first page and the entire second page was completed by the Immigration Officer.\nThe claimant's asserts that he had to wait for 12 hours before the Immigration Department were able to arrange for an interpreter by telephone, who could speak Portuguese, for completion of the balance of the form. He further asserts that the interpreter only assisted for a very short period.\nThe claimant was asked why the only information which seems to be inconsistent and not accurate relates to the basis of his fear. It was pointed out to the claimant that the majority of the information contained in this form, personal details and other specific information, is consistent with his PIF. The claimant again reiterated that he was trying to complete the form without interpretation and that the interpreter only worked with him for a few minutes and that it was because he did not understand the form that the information about his fear is contradictory.\nWhile the panel did not have evidence other than from the claimant about the manner in which this form was completed, the overall accuracy of other parts of the form, being consistent with the PIF leads the panel to doubt the claimant's explanation of how he came to give different information regarding the basis of his fear. On examination of the POE notes it was noted that it was not only in one place that the claimant said the basis for his fear was related to the military service. The claimant states in two places in the form that he was afraid to do his military service.\nThe panel does not find it reasonable to believe that most of the rest of the information would be consistent with the PIF if no interpreter were used given the claimant did not understand English or French. The panel therefore does not find the claimant's evidence regarding the limited interpretation to be credible.\nThe panel finds it reasonable to believe that if an interpreter was used, the substantive questions would be given priority, if they had not been asked or completed, the Immigration Officer would have used the interpreter for those outstanding questions. Given that the claimant made his claim on arrival, even if the form was not completed in ideal circumstances, the panel finds it reasonable to believe that the basis for his fear would have been expressed by the claimant in Portuguese to the interpreter and that that would have been entered into the form that the claimant was involved in completing.\nThe panel therefore does not believe the claimant's explanation about a lack of adequate interpretation as the reason for him stating at the POE that he was afraid to do his military service. The panel believes that at the Port of Entry, the claimant stated that his basis for his fear was fearing to perform his military service, that the country was at war and that he did not want to perform.\nThe panel finds it unreasonable that significant events such as the death of his father or the disappearance of his uncle are not revealed on these POE notes. The panel does not find that his explanation for how the form was completed satisfactorily explains this lack of information, if indeed he revealed it to the Immigration Officer. Therefore, the panel does not believe he did reveal it to the Immigration Officer.\nThe panel finds this to be a fatal contradiction, given that the basis for the claim is the most pertinent aspect of the claim and therefore the lack of credible evidence with respect to the basis for the claim leads the panel to have serious doubts about other aspects of the claimant's testimony, given that he was not able to satisfactorily explain this internal inconsistency.\nThe claimant is asserting that events in Angola led him to flee and to come to Canada to claim asylum. The claimant asserted that he travelled on a Portuguese passport that was not his. The IRB therefore with the claimant's consent inquired of the Portuguese authorities with regard to any status that the person bearing the name and the date of birth of the claimant had in Portugal. The response, which is Exhibit R-2, is a Response to an Acquisition of Information from XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXX XXXXX XXXX, Embassy of Portugal. This communication states: \"XXXXXXXXXXXX, Angolan nationality, born XX\/XX\/75, which had a residence permit expired, awaiting renewal because there are documents missing\".\nWhen the claimant was confronted with this document and asked for an explanation, the claimant explained that it results from events in 1992. He asserts that in 1992 his brother made inquiries of a friend to apply for a residence permit for the claimant in Portugal in order that he could attend \"a naval institute.\" The claimant explained that he had no knowledge of who was asked to make this arrangement. He had no knowledge as to what arrangements were made and when he was asked whether the residence permit was ever issued, the claimant gave contradictory evidence. In the first question by the Refugee Protection Officer regarding this permit, the claimant said that it was \"in force\" and then when asked more specific information, he said that he did not know whether it had been issued and then he said he could not confirm it but he understood that there was a residence permit.\nThe claimant went on to explain that this was in 1992 and that this was also a time when the civil war re-erupted and that no Angolans could leave the country or enter the country and that he was therefore not able to take up this residence permit and he does not know any more about that situation. He did assert that he was never in Portugal and that this was the only attempt made to get a residence permit and that he himself did not make arrangements.\nGiven the claimant's inconsistent responses and also the vagueness with which he responded with regard to whether, in fact, a residence permit had been ever issued to him, the panel finds the claimant's evidence not to be credible.\nThe panel does not find it reasonable to believe that the claimant applied for and obtained an alleged residence permit through the use of a third party without his knowledge and for purposes of studying at a school that he does not know the name of and that he does not know the outcome of the application.\nThe claimant was given notice prior to the hearing that this was a question that would be put to him, given that permission was asked for an order to have the inquiry sent to the Portuguese authority, and the panel finds it to be entirely too convenient that he says this was done in 1992 when the claimant then could assert that it was the war that caused him not to be able to take it up.\nThe claimant gave inconsistent evidence with regard to what he was allegedly to do in Portugal. Initially, he said he was to attend a naval institute and then when asked more specific questions about his schooling, he then revealed that he was to go to Portugal to completed his grades 11 and 12 in one year and then to go to this naval institute. The claimant had no knowledge of where this institute was. He could provide no other information and the panel simply finds his evidence too vague to be credible with respect to what the alleged plans were for him to study in Portugal.\nWhile the panel recognizes that the response from the Portuguese authorities does not state specific dates as to when XXXXXXXXXX had a residence permit, when it expired and exactly what documents were missing, the panel finds that the statement that there was a residence permit, it did expire and the renewal was awaiting further documents, leads the panel to find on a balance of probabilities that a permit had been issued and had expired and that a renewal was being sought. The panel finds this to be credible evidence that there was a residence permit issued to the claimant. The claimant provided insufficient credible evidence to establish that he never resided in Portugal at some point, seeking renewal of that permit.\nThe panel finds the claimant's evidence was too vague in the details about his studies and who was arranging for this to find it credible that this was the same residence permit as referred to in the documents from the Portuguese Embassy. Therefore, the panel finds the claimant's assertion that he was living in Angola from the time of his birth until his departure in 2001 not to be supported by credible evidence.\nThe passport that the claimant travelled on bore no stamps of any travel other than entry into the United States. The claimant asserts that he travelled through South Africa, Madrid and Zurich on his way to the United States. His explanation for the lack of documentary evidence such as his ticket to establish this route, to establish the date that he left Angola and the route that he took, was that the ticket was kept by the church leader who had organized the tour and who kept the ticket and the passport.\nThe claimant asserted that he contacted this individual to get his passport but did not ask for the ticket. The fact that he made no effort to present the ticket, which could have established his route, leads the panel to doubt that the ticket would establish this route and therefore leads the panel to doubt that this was in fact the route that the claimant took.\nThe lack of any stamps from Madrid or Zurich in the Portuguese passport does not raise any issue because of the likelihood that European countries do not stamp a European passport. However, the panel finds it reasonable to believe there would be an entry or an exit or a transit stamp in a Portuguese passport from the South African authorities. While the panel has no evidence specifically on this point, the burden is on the claimant to establish his route and the claimant did not provide the ticket and therefore the panel finds this to be a lack of credible evidence to establish that the claimant was in Angola when he asserts, or left at the time he asserts, or that the incidents that he details in his PIF occurred.\nIn addition to these issues of credibility, there were serious concerns about the credibility of other documents submitted in support of the claimant's assertions and his explanations regarding these concerns. The claimant presented what he describes as an original death certificate relating to the death of his father in XXXX 2001. However, the panel finds the claimant's evidence with respect to how this came to be provided, how it came into existence and the purpose for which it was issued not to be credible.\nThe claimant asserts that his father was killed, the family never saw the body and the police would never acknowledge what happened. The claimant asserts that after meeting with his lawyer regarding the preparation of his refugee claim, he contacted his mother and told her that he needed certain information or documents that could support his claim. He indicated that his mother went to the authorities to request the death certificate some time after XXXXX 2001. The claimant's PIF was presented on June 19, 2001 and he then contacted his mother to make the request. His mother sent this document two or three months ago in 2003. The panel was provided with the DHL envelope dated March 2003 to confirm that this is when it was received but the claimant is asserting that it was requested some time in XXXXX 2001.\nThe claimant asserts that his mother told the authorities that she was a widow and needed to be able to prove that in order to get benefits. This was the reason she provided for applying for the document. The claimant was asked questions about this document and specifically his attention was drawn to the fact that the date of issue of this document was XXXXX, 2001. The claimant was asked to explain why this document would be issued on a date prior to his having made the request of his mother to go to the Angolan authorities to get proof of his father's death.\nIn attempting to explain why the date was in advance of the request having been made, the claimant reiterated that his mother had to have a reason for asking for it and that she used the need to get benefits as the reason. He also asserted that the government did not want to admit what had happened to his father. The claimant never actually directly dealt with this inconsistency of dates in his evidence. The claimant never asserted that his mother was in possession of this document prior to him requesting it. His evidence was that when he requested it from her, she then went to the authorities and the claimant had no explanation for the date. The panel does not find his evidence in regard to the death certificate to be credible.\nThe claimant asserted that the government was not willing to issue a document concerning his father's death because they wanted to deny responsibility. The death certificate indicates that the cause of death was homicide with a firearm and it indicates that the death took\nplace on XXXXXX, 2001. The claimant is asserting that this document indicates that the authorities are responsible for his father's death. The panel finds that this document does not establish anything other than his father died as a result of a fatal shot on a certain date.\nThe panel therefore finds his evidence regarding his father's death inconsistent and the claimant did not provide any credible evidence to explain the inconsistencies. The claimant therefore has presented insufficient credible evidence to establish that his father was killed by the authorities under the circumstances that he alleges.\nThe panel asked the claimant to explain why the mother would risk going to the police, if as he asserts, it was clear that the note allegedly from the police was indicating that they wanted to arrest her. The claimant's explanation was that she wanted to find out what happened to her other son. The panel asked the claimant to explain why the authorities, if they were interested in arresting the mother and the claimant, would not arrest the mother when she presented herself at the police station. The claimant explained that he believed that it was because the police wanted the claimant and that if they detained the mother, there would be less likelihood of the claimant reporting. The panel simply does not find this to be plausible.\nThe panel does not find it to be reasonable that the authorities in Angola would not detain the mother when she presented herself if indeed they wanted to detain her. They allegedly detained the brother and it is inconsistent that if they had wanted to detain the whole family that they would not detain the mother when she presented herself and then subsequently continue to look for the claimant.\nThe panel therefore finds that the internal inconsistencies between the PIF and the Port of Entry, the lack of any reasonable explanations, the claimant's lack of credible evidence regarding his being in Angola at the time he asserts and having had a residence permit in Portugal, the lack of credible evidence regarding the circumstances of the death of his father; all lead the panel to find that the claimant's entire evidence is suspect. The panel therefore finds there is insufficient credible evidence to establish that he has a well-founded fear of persecution in Angola on the basis of imputed political opinion or membership in a particular social group or any other ground in the definition of a Convention refugee.\nDETERMINATION\nThe panel therefore finds that XXXXXXXXXXXXX is not a Convention refugee. Given the findings of lack of credibility, the panel further finds insufficient credible evidence to establish that the claimant is a person in need of protection in that there are no reasonable grounds to believe that he personally faces a risk of torture or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a risk to his life were he to be returned to Angola. I therefore reject his claim.\n\"Eunice Harker\"\nEunice Harker\nDated at Ottawa this 24th day of October 2003.\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - CREDIBILITY - DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE - EVIDENCE - MALE - NEGATIVE - ANGOLA\nRPD File # \/ No. dossier SPR : ___________\n1\nRPD File # \/ No. dossier SPR : AA1-00611\n12\n",

The claimants, who are siblings and in their teenage years, except for XXXXXX, who is 20 years old\n- XXXXX is 18; XXXXX is 17; and XXXX is 14 - allege that they are Somali citizens born in Somalia and forced to flee to Kenya at a very young age, where they have lived since 1991 without status and in circumstances of poverty.\nIn the year 2000, they were sent to Canada by their grandmother with whom they were living in Kenya, their father being nowhere to be found and their mother likewise. Because the grandmother could no longer care for them, she sent them to join their aunt, her daughter here in Canada.\nTheir Narrative that was prepared by the aunt XXXXX says that they cannot return to Somalia because they are children on their own without protection.\nANALYSIS\nIn my analysis of this claim, I want to begin with the observation that the young people who appeared before me are attractive, polite and well educated. They present themselves well and, probably if they are allowed to remain in Canada, would be successful, contributing members of Canadian society. But my task is not to pass judgment on them because of their pleasing personalities, their evident determination to get an education and do well by themselves. It is to examine the evidence before me in order to determine whether or not they are Convention refugees or have established that they are in need of Canada's protection, as defined in section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nIn addressing myself to that task, I begin with the issues that were identified at the beginning of the hearing and mentioned by the Refugee Protection Officer in her observations. are credibility and identity, and they are intertwined. There are no documents before me - the claimants presented no documents - to establish that they were born and raised initially in Somalia. Furthermore, I have no documents before me, and the claimants presented no documents to establish that they had spent nine years in Kenya. However, they do speak English and Swahili, which are the two major languages in Kenya. As their aunt, in the Narrative that she prepared on their behalf, says \"They learned Swahili and speak it very well. They also speak English very well because they were schooled several hours a day by their Somali teacher.\"\nThis leads me to the following question. If they are not Somali citizens because they were born in Somalia, are they ethnic Somalis living in Kenya, i.e. are they Kenyans of Somali extraction? There are substantial Somali-speaking groups in Kenya as well as Djibouti and Ethiopia, and it could well be that they are ethnic Somalis who have never set foot in Somalia. So it is these questions that I must keep in mind as I examine their testimony.\nI can understand why they may not have any documents from Somalia as they were very young when they left, but I cannot understand why it is that they have no documents from Kenya, no paper whatsoever. It may be that identity documents is not the issue here, but something to establish that they lived in Kenya other than the fact that they speak English and Swahili. I note that their aunt, who appeared as an identity witness, had a successful refugee claim in Canada and that the PIF in her claim was entered as Exhibit R-3. Counsel argued, in her submissions, that this establishes that the claimants are from Somalia, but I cannot use this decision to establish that the claimants are indeed from Somalia. It could be that this was a fraudulent claim that escaped the notice of the panel hearing it. I note, for example, that in the Narrative of Exhibit R-3, the claimant said she has no knowledge of where her husband is. In fact, she says \"I believe he is in custody or more probably that he has been killed by the government.\", and yet this claim was heard in February of 1989, and she told me at the hearing\ninto this claim that in May of 1989 her husband showed up in Canada. This is an amazing coincidence that a man who she suspected was either in custody or dead, a man whose whereabouts were unknown, suddenly, two months later, shows up in Canada after his wife made a successful refugee claim.\nThat observation aside the weight I can give to Exhibit R-3 in establishing that what the aunt, XXXXXXXXXXX, says about her alleged nieces and nephews, that they are indeed Somali citizens is problematic, especially in light of the rest of the testimony that I have heard, which I find, in its important essentials, not to be credible. In other words, if the rest of the testimony with regard to the circumstances of these children were more credible, I might be able to give more weight to the PIF and testimony of the witness. But I cannot because it is not.\nFor example, one of the major assertions in the Narrative as prepared by their aunt XXXXX XXXX is that the father of the children was Madiban or Midgan. The Madibans or Midgans are a despised minority in Somalia, and yet, the aunt XXXXXX asserts that the mother of these claimants married her husband XXXXXXXX not knowing he was a Midgan. I did not find this plausible so I asked the aunt about her family background. She said her father was a merchant. He sold goats and cows and that he was fairly well off. He made enough money to support a family of nine children. He was an Isaaq and a respected businessman in the community, so much so that he was a member and a supporter of the Somalia National Movement.\nIt is not plausible to me that such a man would allow his daughter to marry a man who posed as a Sheikhal, which is a tribe or clan that would be acceptable in terms of marriage, that he would give permission without investigating this man's background. I put that to the aunt, and she said he trusted him. But Somalia is a clan-based society. Clan is paramount and clan, as this claimant confirmed, and as I know from hearing hundreds of Somali claims in my eight years on the Board, is among the first things that Somalis ask about each other when they meet, and I don't find it believable that this man would allow his daughter to marry somebody without investigating his background. It is easy to do in Somalia. You simply float the question. The father was a merchant. He would have contacted fellow clan members in the merchant community in Mogadishu to find out what they knew about this potential son-in-law. In fact, this is XXXXXX testimony as to how he eventually learned that his daughter had married a Midgan. When I asked how it was finally established that the son-in-law was a Midgan, XXXX said that people told her father, his close friends who were travelling back and forth told him that XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX was a Midgan.\nMy response to that is this would be precisely the mode of communication that the father would have used initially before he approved of the marriage.\nSo I don't believe that these children before me are Midgans because their father was a Midgan, and I note that this allegation of belonging to this despised minority clan is a boilerplate allegation. I have heard it time and time again, and I believe that claimants by and large use this allegation of their clan origin to embellish their claim in an effort to improve their chances of getting a successful determination. It is so commonplace that it is something that one is surprised when one doesn't hear it.\nSo in summary then, it doesn't make any sense to me that this man, a successful businessman, a middle-class man, with connections through his business, would not have investigated his future son-in-law to make sure he was an acceptable husband for his daughter. This would be commonplace in a clan-based society where marriages are often arranged. The notion that, in such a society, people get married because of romance, a notion, I suppose, that has been fostered by Hollywood, is very foreign to Somali society.\nMy second credibility concern has to do with the claimants' knowledge\nof English. The children in this alleged marriage of a Midgan man and an Isaaq woman speak English very well, and I had all four of them sit down and I asked them questions about their education and so on and so forth. Their language skills in the English language is such that\nI would be hard pressed in listening to them to distinguish them from a native-born Canadian.\nTheir alleged aunt who has been here for close to 15 years has an accent. Her alleged nieces and nephews do not. They are four young people who have been immersed in the English language, for some time; their expressions, their pronunciation, their enunciation, all confirm that notion.\nTheir explanations for this is that they were tutored in the language for four years in Kenya but I do not find that explanation to be plausible because the testimony of the aunt was that the claimants lived with her mother, their grandmother, in very dire circumstances. They lived in one room, the four of them. They depended on handouts, financial contributions coming from XXXXXX and her brother in Toronto and a relative in Nairobi. Indeed XXXXX, living on social assistance here in Canada sent money, anywhere from $50 to $100 every few months or so.\nAnd yet these youngsters living in those circumstances had a hired tutor to teach them English, according to the testimony of the aunt and the testimony of the oldest child XXXXX. The first tutor named XXXXX was paid 300 to 400 Kenyan shillings per month. Then the next tutor, one XXXXX XXXXXX, was given room and board to tutor these children. This is a scenario that makes no sense to me whatsoever.\nAnd I note from my specialized knowledge of the situation for urban refugees in Nairobi that they live in squalid housing conditions, often without access to food, clean water, medical care, jobs or education. Women and children are subjected to sexual abuse at the hands of their fellow refugees. They have to pay bribes to escape round-ups, bribes to avoid spending time in the country's crowded and filthy jails.\nIn summary, the situation for urban refugees is abominable, and these young people must have lived it in a single room, sometimes without anything to eat. Two or three times a month, we were told they wouldn't have enough to eat. And yet money and room and board are given to tutors to teach them English. I don't believe it.\nNor do I believe that if their situation was that dire, and their testimony is that it was, they would have not been sent here sooner. The money that the grandmother allegedly got from selling her jewellery to contribute to their eventual travel to Canada, the money that the aunt who is living here and the brother who is living in Toronto and the relative who is living in Kenya would have been gathered together a lot sooner to get them out of that unspeakable situation, especially the two girls.\nI believe they speak English so well because, as I have already said, they have been immersed in an English language culture, probably North American. Their language skills are such that they are far beyond what they would be if they were simply tutored. And I don't believe they were tutored, certainly not in the circumstances they allege they were. It makes no sense that money and\/or room and board would be spent on tutors when there was barely enough food to go around.\nAnother credibility issue that I raise - it's not a major one, but it's a curious one in the sense that I can't understand it is why XXXXX, the oldest of the children, would lie about her travel to Canada. She was asked what the route was to Canada, and she said she took an airplane, the four of them with the smuggler, from Kenya to Holland. \"What airline?\" I asked. She said she thought it was American Airlines. \"What was the airline that you took from Holland to the United States?\" She said again she thought it was American Airlines. Where did you land in the United States? She said she didn't know. She said they took a bus from the airport in some unknown American city to the border. \"Where was that?\" I asked. She said she didn't know.\nI simply don't believe her. I believe she would be able to tell me or one of the other children would be able to tell me where they landed in the United States given their language skills. They would be able to tell me what American city they left and what American city they went to by bus.\nFurthermore, I note that all of their PIFs say they arrived at Niagara Falls, Ontario. The other side of Niagara Falls, Ontario, is Buffalo. I would expect that if they knew they arrived at Niagara Falls XXXXX would know that she had been in Buffalo.\nAnd I note again that in terms of documentation, there are no airline ticket stubs to confirm the story that they flew from Kenya to Holland, from Holland to the United States. Neither are there bus ticket stubs to confirm their story that they took a bus from wherever they landed in the United States to wherever they went to at the border.\nFurthermore, I find that the story told by their aunt about their arrival in Canada is not plausible. Her story is that she didn't know they were coming and that she received a call from the border from the smuggler that they were here. I don't find that to make any sense to me whatsoever. I do not believe that the claimants' grandmother would send them with a smuggler without, first of all, determining that XXXXX was going to be here to greet them. The two of them had been in contact off and on every month or so. So it makes no sense to me that there would not be some kind of telephone call to say \"Look, the children are coming at such and such a place at such and such a time. Would you meet them.\"\nAt the very least, one would want to confirm that the person to whom you were sending these young people was going to be available to pick them up and not vacationing somewhere or travelling somewhere, or sick and unable to pick them up. It makes no sense that these young people would be sent without that being done.\nSo on these two issues, I do not believe the testimony that I received; that is, the issue of not knowing they were coming and the children not knowing where they landed in the United States and to which border point they went before they crossed into Canada. Furthermore,\nI don't understand why they are not telling the truth here, except to say that they are hiding something, and it may be that what they are hiding is residency in the United States or some other English language country, which would explain their facility in English, certainly more so than their explanation that they were tutored for four years.\nDETERMINATION\nIn conclusion, I find that because these claimants have not established that they are who they say they are, i.e. Somali nationals, and have not established that they lived where they said they lived, their account of their life in Somalia and Kenya is not believable. Given those findings I have no option but to find that they are not Convention refugees or otherwise in need of Canada's protection for reasons outlined in section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\"Gary F.

The claimant is a 29-year-old unmarried male who claims a well-founded fear of persecution on the grounds of political opinion, religion and membership in a particular social group, namely a conscientious objector. He further claims to be a person in need of protection in that his removal to Turkey would subject him personally to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment and a risk to his life and to a danger of torture.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant asserts that he is a devout follower of the Turkish Islamist leader Fetullah Gulen, and that his involvement with this Hizmet organization began in 1992 when he attended university. He lived in the \"lighthouses\", the accommodations provided by the movement, which were dormitories and places of study, which also provided free education and religious instruction for high school students. The claimant worked his way up in the movement becoming the imam for his division (approximately 6 lighthouses) by 1996 and for the district (approximately 15-20 lighthouses) between 1997-2000.\nThe claimant finished his university studies in 1997 and began an accounting internship but he also continued to tutor high school students at the lighthouse where he lived. Twenty or so high school students would attend regularly for supplementary educational instruction and religious instruction in the principles of Risale-I-Nur, the text interpreting the Koran that Fetullah Gulen adheres to.\nThe claimant asserts that the lighthouses were raided and he was detained on three separate occasions regarding his activities with Hizmet between 1997 and XXXXX 2000 and it was the last detention that prompted his departure from Turkey. The claimant asserts that he was questioned extensively during the detentions about his activities and associates in the movement and he further asserts that during one of these detentions he was tortured. The claimant fears further detentions, torture and that the agents of the state might kill him.\nThe claimant also asserts that he fled Turkey because he is a conscientious objector as a consequence of his following of Fetullah Gulen. The claimant asserts that he had deferrals for his military service because he was studying but that he will be required to perform his service and that doing so is contrary to his conscientiously held belief in not carrying arms. He fears that if forced to perform his military service he would be prohibited from praying, as his religion requires. Further if it became known that he is a follower of Hizmet he would be sent to the north or the southeast against the Kurds, and would suffer severe treatment in the military as a consequence of his religious beliefs. He further asserts that as he has had reporting notices since he left Turkey, he is now evading his military service.\nThe claimant left Turkey on his own legal passport on XXXX, 2001, spent XX days in the USA arriving in Windsor, Canada on 19 April 2001. He made his refugee claim on 30 May 2001 in Ottawa.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\nThe claimant established his personal and citizenship identity through the credible identity documents he provided in support of his assertions.\nWell-foundedness of fear based on Fetullah Gulen membership\nThe panel does not find sufficient credible evidence to establish on a balance of probabilities that the claimant's fear is objectively well founded.\nThe claimant asserts that he fears persecution based on his treatment as a consequence of his involvement with the Fetullah Gulen movement and also because he has failed to respond to notices to perform his compulsory military service.\nRegarding his treatment as a consequence of his involvement with Fetullah Gulen, the claimant asserts that he was detained and questioned by State Security Officers for three days in XXXX 1997. The claimant continued his activities from a different location and claimed that this \"lighthouse\" was under surveillance in XXXXX 1999 for approximately 3 months. He moved again and then was one of 5 people who were detained, questioned and tortured by being beaten on the soles of his feet for a day in XXXXX 2000. Again the claimant was released and he moved to another location.\nThe claimant asserts that he was questioned by plain-clothed officers in mid-XXXX 2000 and that he was detained again in XXXXX 2000 by the anti-terrorism department of the police. He claims he was questioned for two days about activities and associates, named on a list in his possession. In each of the incidents the claimant did not provide any information to the authorities and he was never forced to sign any confession or undertaking to cease his activities.\nThe panel does not find the claimant's evidence with regard to his detentions to be credible for the following reasons. The claimant in his oral evidence described being tortured with sticks during his detention in XXXXX 2000. There is no mention of torture during this detention in his account of it in his PIF. The claimant's explanation was that he must have omitted to mention it when the narrative was being prepared. The panel notes that the details of the incident in the PIF were quite expansive and contained significant details. Details such as being beaten with sticks to give information would seem to be an important fact to include, especially when the claimant does give details such as the policemen swore at him when they were not satisfied with the answers he was giving them to their questions.\nThe panel does not accept the claimant's explanation for the omission as credible, and finds the claimant was fabricating to bolster his claim. His account of his XXXXX 2000 detention and allegation of torture are not credible.\nThe claimant asserts that he experienced three serious detentions during which time he was questioned extensively about the movement, structure and membership. Yet he maintains that no one higher in the structure ever indicated to him that they had been questioned in a similar fashion. The claimant knew very little about the details of activities above him and maintained that his only activities were to provide free supplementary education to high school students and to have responsibility for the running of a number of similar schools. The panel does not find it to be reasonable to believe that if the authorities had such a serious interest in this organisation that they would have restricted themselves to questioning the claimant and a few others at his level, and would never have shown any interest in people more senior to the claimant. The panel does not find the claimant's evidence in this regard to be credible.\nThe claimant asserted that he never gave any information despite being questioned over a period of days, with psychological pressure, sleep deprivation and beaten on the soles of his feet with sticks used as methods to elicit information. He further asserts that his questioners were never satisfied with his answers yet he was always released without any conditions. Given the documentary evidence concerning the use of torture in Turkey, and the determination of the military and police in getting information and confessions through the use of torture, the panel finds the claimant's evidence about being released after giving no information and his ability to resist giving information to be not credible.\nThe claimant asserted that he was questioned about the students they were teaching and yet none of their parents were questioned about the school and what was being taught to their children. The panel does not find it to be reasonable to believe that the authorities would have such an interest in the claimant's schools and yet would not have questioned the students or their parents as part of their investigation. The panel does not find the claimant's evidence to be credible in this regard.\nThe claimant asserts that in XXXX 2000 he was detained and a list of contacts was seized. His evidence was that he was asked extensive questions about the individuals on the list and that he gave partially truthful answers. However none of the people named on the list were ever questioned by the authorities. The panel does not find this to be plausible. If the authorities were intent on gathering information about this organisation, and the extent of its influence, and were seriously interested in the individuals named on the list in the claimant's possession, it would seem reasonable to believe that the people named would also be questioned concerning their relationship with the claimant. Given the efficiency of the Turkish State evidenced in the documentary evidence, it is simply not credible that only the claimant would be questioned.\nDocumentary evidence1 indicates that beginning in February 1997 the Turkish military established the BCG known in English as the Western Working Group to \"monitor Islamist sympathisers in the civil service and other state organs\". Several of their key officers were influential in the 28 February Process which was a military-led campaign against Islamic activism which led to Prime Minister Erbakan's resignation and forced its first Islamist-led government from office. The only reference to the monitoring of Fetullah Gulen during the research for this response is that the WWG had prepared a file dealing with the followers, which focused on Gulen's educational institutions abroad.\nThe documentary evidence reveals that there were detentions and restrictions placed on a number of religious sects or groups between 1997 and 2001. However there is nothing in the documentary evidence that indicates that followers of Fetullah Gulen were subject to detentions or arrests or restrictions other than charges being laid against the leader in absentia in 2000. He was indicted in Turkey in August 2000, in absentia, on charges of setting up an illegal organisation with the aim of changing the secular state to a state based on religious principles, and a prison sentence of 10 years is being sought. He had left Turkey in March 1999 and has been in the USA since.\nExhibit R-12 is a credible review of religious freedom and restrictions in Turkey. There is insufficient evidence in this document to support the assertion that followers of Fetullah Gulen were restricted in their activities or practice of their religion, harassed or discriminated against. The document does indicate restrictions on Islamic and Christian groups and details abuses of religious freedom. However followers of Fetullah Gulen are not among those listed.\nExhibit C-53 indicates some cassettes and slides of Fetullah Gulen were taken when student residences in the province of Budur were raided in XXXXX 2001. These raids were conducted when the governor of the state was out of the state for 20 days. On his return the governor was working on having any such investigations stopped. The panel finds this to be a specific incident of excessive behaviour on the part of individuals in a specific place and not evidence of widespread treatment amounting to persecution of members of Fetullah Gulen.\nGiven the above-mentioned lack of credibility in the claimant's evidence and the documentary evidence being silent regarding detentions and arrests of followers of Fetullah Gulen, the panel does not believe that the claimant was ever detained. The panel does not believe that the claimant was tortured. The panel cannot find sufficient evidence to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant's fear of persecution based on his involvement with Fetullah Gulen is objectively well founded.\nWell-foundedness of fear based on conscientious objection\nRegarding the claimant's conscientious objection to military service the panel finds that the claimant has failed to establish on a balance of probabilities that he would face more than a mere possibility of persecution for a Convention ground.\nThe claimant has been able to get deferrals of his military service because of his educational activities and his involvement in some kind of accountancy apprenticeship until the time that he left Turkey. He legally applied for and was legally issued a Turkish passport and\ndid not pay any bribe in order to have it issued. The panel therefore finds that he has a legally issued Turkish passport. His evidence regarding his exit from Turkey is that he was able to exit the country legally and without any assistance.\nThe documentary evidence reveals that it would be very unlikely that the claimant would have been issued a passport if he was liable for military service and had no valid deferral. The documentary evidence further indicates that it would be highly unlikely that the claimant would have been able to exit Turkey legally if he had no legal deferral of his military service. The panel therefore finds that the claimant was not evading military service when he left Turkey.\nThe claimant asserts that he is considered to be evading military service now as he has received notices to appear and has failed to respond. He asserts that he is a conscientious objector based on his religious and conscientiously held beliefs. He further objected to having to be in any way involved in human rights abuses in the north or southeast which he believes he would be required to do because of his religious affiliation. The documentary evidence4 reveals that since the end of 1999, military action in the southeast is significantly less and any raids that do occur are usually carried out by regular troops. The same is also the case for Northern Iraq.\nTherefore the possibility of conscripts having to perform duties in either of these areas is extremely slight. The panel therefore finds there would be less than a mere possibility of this happening to the claimant.\nFurther the documentary evidence reveals that the selection of location for conscripts is done by random computer process with the parameters of place of residence and specialist training factored in. Therefore the panel finds that the claimant's assertion that he would be forced into service in either of the conflict areas because of his religious affiliation is not supported by the documentary evidence.\nThe claimant has never revealed to anyone in the state apparatus that he is a follower of Fetullah Gulen, and the panel has found his evidence of his detentions not to be credible. The panel therefore finds that there is less than a mere possibility that he would be discovered to be a follower while performing his military service. According to the claimant other followers have performed their compulsory service and therefore it is not a tenet of being a follower to be opposed to performing military service.\nThe claimant asserts that he would not be able to pray regularly if he was forced to perform his compulsory service. Turkey is a determined secular state and the military is one of the most dedicated to this philosophy however the documentary evidence does not support the assertion that the claimant would be prevented from the practice of his private prayerful devotions while performing his military service.\nThe documentary evidence indicates that there is no systemic discrimination against any specific group or ethnicity in the military. Discipline is harsh but is not discriminatorily applied. This does not support the claimant's assertion that he would be singled out for harsh treatment or punishment because of his religious affiliation.\nThere is no provision for alternative service for those who are conscientiously opposed to perform their compulsory military service. Even if the panel were to accept the claimant's assertion that he is credibly a conscientious objector on philosophical grounds to bearing arms, the requirement of a state for its citizens to comply with its law on compulsory military service is not in and of itself persecution. Rather it is a law of general application.\nThe manner in which the law itself might be applied could be discriminatory or persecutory. In a review of the documentary evidence the panel relies on Exhibit R-15 as credible evidence that the sentences for evasion or refusal to perform are not excessive to the point that they could in and of themselves be regarded as persecutory. Neither is there evidence\nthat they are discriminatorily applied on the basis of religious belief, political opinion or ethnicity. The documentary evidence reveals that the minimum sentences are usually applied, prison sentences are frequently reduced to a fine and suspended sentences are also routine.\nIn all of this evidence the panel does not find evidence to support an assertion that there is more than a mere possibility that the law of general application would be discriminatorily applied on any Convention ground to the claimant such that it would amount to persecution, were he to be prosecuted for failing to perform his military service.\nThe claimant presented a letter from the Turkish government in Ottawa indicating that he could have his citizenship revoked if he did not return to perform his military service. The documentary evidence reveals that this is a punishment that the Turkish government can impose. It takes several years to process. The claimant if he was subjected to this sanction could apply to have his citizenship restored and on application this is usually done on the condition that the military requirement is complied with. The panel therefore does not find this to be other than a law of general application and there is no evidence to support any assertion that this would be discriminatorily applied to the claimant for any ground in the definition of Convention refugee.\nSubjective Fear\nEven if the panel found the claimant's evidence to be credible regarding his alleged detentions and torture, the panel finds that the claimant does not have a subjective fear of persecution for the following reasons.\nThe panel finds the claimant has failed to provide sufficient credible evidence of behaviour consistent with a subjective fear of persecution.\nThe claimant asserts that he was detained and questioned by State Security Officers for three days in XXXXX 1997 regarding his involvement with Hizmet. The claimant continued his activities from a different location and claimed that this \"lighthouse\" was under surveillance in XXXXXX 1999 for approximately 3 months. He moved again and then was one of 5 people who were detained, questioned and tortured by being beaten on the soles of his feet for a day in XXXXX 2000. Again the claimant was released and he moved to another location. The claimant asserts that he was questioned by plain-clothed officers in mid-XXXXX 2000 and was then encouraged by a senior imam to apply for his passport after this in XXXXX 2000.\nThe passport was issued in XXXX 2000, however the claimant remained in Turkey. He asserts that he was detained again in XXXXX 2000 by the anti-terrorism department of the police and questioned for two days about activities and associates, named on a list in his possession. The claimant asserts that he was very fearful, anxious and depressed but did not leave Turkey for another 5 months.\nAfter each incident with state authorities the claimant asserts that someone more senior in the movement told him where to go to live when the lighthouse he had been living in was closed. He applied for a passport when told by a senior imam to do so and the claimant's evidence regarding the timing of his departure from Turkey was that he was told to leave when the more senior imam believed the danger for him was \"mature\". When asked why he did not feel compelled to leave after his detention in XXXXX 2000 after being tortured the claimant's evidence was that the senior imam did not believe the danger to be \"mature\" at that time. The claimant also gave evidence that he had to seek the permission of the city and regional imams before leaving Turkey in XXXX 2001.\nWhen asked why he did not feel compelled to leave Turkey immediately after he had been tortured for information about his movement in XXXXX 2000 the claimant revealed that he was responding to the instructions of his imam. The imam believed that the danger was not serious enough to warrant other than moving the claimant. Every time he moved his living quarters after\nan incident it was as a result of instructions by others in the movement. In response to questions regarding his reasons for not leaving Turkey immediately after receiving his passport following the incident in XXXXX 2000, the claimant revealed that he was responding to the instructions of others. The imam had advised him to get a passport in case but that the danger was not yet \"mature\".\nThe claimant did not decide for himself that he felt himself to be in danger, after allegedly being tortured in XXXX 2000, such that he should leave Turkey. He preferred to take the advice of his imam. He did not decide for himself to apply for his passport after being seriously questioned again by the police in XXXX 2000, rather he followed instructions. Even after having a legal passport the claimant did not decide for himself that he should leave Turkey for his protection, rather he remained and endured another detention in XXXX 2000. Even after this detention the claimant waited in Turkey until XXXX 2001 before he left. His explanation for this delay is that he had to get permission from two different imams and for arrangements for his visa to be made.\nGiven the claimant's assertion that the most serious incident he experienced was in XXXXX 2000, the panel finds that not leaving his country for another nine months to be behaviour inconsistent with a stated fear. If as he alleges the XXXX 2000 incident was the most serious it is not plausible that he would only start to fear in XXXX and start making his plans then. The claimant had a legally issued Turkish passport in XXXX 2000 and yet he did not make efforts to leave for more than another five or six months. Even if it was credible that it was his detention in XXXXX which was the precipitating incident, the claimant still delayed his leaving by more than 4 months. The panel again finds this to be behaviour inconsistent with a stated fear. The panel finds that the claimant was responding to the instructions of others in terms of deciding to leave his country and when and how to do it.\nThe claimant was not unresourceful. He was university educated and by his own admission he had demonstrated leadership in that he took on the responsibility of more than one of the lighthouses early in his involvement and was given further responsibilities after a relatively short period of time. The panel therefore finds his evidence to be implausible. He is educated, able to take on significant responsibilities, and he felt significantly fearful after each encounter with the police or security service and asserts that he was motivated by fear to leave his country. He did not assert nor did he persuade the panel that he was someone who was in any way extraordinarily brave or dedicated to his cause despite the risks, which might explain his remaining for so long after his alleged torture before leaving his country. Further he did not assert that he did not leave because he still had work he wanted to do. Rather he left when instructed to do so. The panel notes that Exhibit R-1 Tab 9, RIR TUR377763, quotes a Ph.D. Dissertation, September 2001, on the Fetullah Gulen movement, as saying 'there is free access and exit'. The panel finds that the claimant was free to make his own decisions, but chose not to do so.\nIf the claimant was as fearful as he asserts, and given his resourcefulness, it seems only reasonable to expect that he would leave as soon as he had the passport. In all of this evidence the panel finds that the claimant left his country as a consequence of the instructions of others and was not motivated by his own subjective fear to do so.\nWhile a claimant is not required to make a refugee claim in the first country he enters, his reasons for not doing so must be examined and be reasonable. The claimant had a visa for the USA but did not make his asylum claim in the USA. His reasons for not doing so were that he had always intended to come to Canada, and that he had to wait in the USA to get his visa and a cheap flight to Canada. His intention to come to Canada was based on his assessment of the much better respect for human rights in Canada.\nWhen questioned further on his reasons for not making a claim in the USA, given the fact that his spiritual leader is there and is establishing a considerable structure of schools and followers, the claimant explained that he did not want to cause a problem for his leader.\nThe panel does not accept the claimant's explanations as reasonable or credible. Fetullah Gulen is in the USA and the documentary evidence establishes that his followers are establishing schools and are able to participate in the activities of the movement. The panel is aware that the USA has a system for determining refugee claims. Given the presence of a considerable number of his countrymen already in the USA and that he was in possession of a visa for the USA, the panel does not find it to be reasonable that the claimant would not have made a claim on arrival in the USA. The panel finds the explanation that he only spent 11 days in the USA not relevant. Further the panel does not find it to be reasonable to believe that the claimant making an asylum claim in the USA could adversely affect Fetullah Gulen's situation in the USA or in Turkey. There was no credible evidence presented to support this assertion thus the panel finds it not to be credible.\nThe panel finds that in not making an asylum claim in the USA the claimant has demonstrated behaviour inconsistent with a stated fear of persecution.\nFurther the claimant did not make his claim on arrival at a border in Canada, despite his assertion that this was his intention when he left Turkey. He waited another month and a half. His explanation was that he had to make contacts with his movement here and then wait until someone who could speak good English could go with him to make the appointment. When he went to Immigration he was given an appointment to go back some time later thus explaining the month and a half delay. The claimant could not give a precise date as to when he went first to Immigration but his PIF states he first made his intention known to an SIO on 30 May 2001.\nThe panel does not accept the claimant's explanation as credible. Refugee claimants frequently make their claim on arrival at the border without knowing the process or without being able to speak the language. The claimant insists that his stated destination and intention was to come to Canada to make a refugee claim. In not making a claim at the border or within a reasonable amount of time of coming to Canada the claimant has again demonstrated behaviour inconsistent with a fear of persecution.\nThe panel does not believe he was motivated to make his claim out of fear. The claimant has demonstrated behaviour consistent with acting on the instructions of others and then doing what was expected of him. The panel finds the evidence shows that the claimant has been told when to leave Turkey, where to come and then what to do. The panel finds that the evidence does not demonstrate behaviour consistent with a personal subjective fear.\nFor all of the above reasons the panel finds that the claimant failed to provide credible evidence that his fear was objectively well founded. The evidence regarding his alleged detentions was not credible. In addition, even if that evidence had been credible, he failed to provide sufficient credible evidence of a subjective fear of persecution.\nPossible exclusion under article 1F(a) was raised as an issue, but nothing in the claimant's evidence regarding his activities, and nothing in the documentary evidence regarding the activities of the movement, supported any further examination of this issue in this particular case. The panel therefore finds no evidence to support possible exclusion in this case, even if the panel had found credible evidence that the claimant was a Convention refugee.\nDETERMINATION\nFor all these reasons, I find XXXXXXXXX not to be a Convention refugee as he does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in Turkey. Given my findings above regarding the lack of credibility of the claimant's evidence, I also find that the claimant is not a person in need of protection in that his removal to Turkey would not subject him personally to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, and in that there are no substantial grounds to believe that his removal to Turkey will subject him personally to a danger of torture. I therefore reject his claim.\n\"Eunice Harker\"\nEunice Harker\nDated at Ottawa this 24th day of January 2003.\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - POLITICAL OPINION - RELIGION - CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION - MILITARY SERVICE -CREDIBILITY - MALE - NEGATIVE - TURKEY\n1 Exhibit R-1, Tab 7, RIR TUR38370, 2 February 2002\n2 Tab 2, U.S. DOS International Religious Freedom Report, 2001\n3 Tab 24, Excerpt from Cumhuriyet Newspaper 2001\n4 R-1, Tab 5, The U.

He claims to have a well-founded fear of persecution in his country based on his adherence to the Pentecostal religion and his Russian and Lippovan nationality. He also claims that he is a person in need of protection as he would be subject personally to a danger of torture, to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. The claimant claims to fear imprisonment upon his return to Romania for contravening Romanian law dealing with illegal immigration.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant stated the following:\nHis parents were born in Romania. The claimant alleged that he constantly had problems in school because of his Lippovan nationality; his teachers and classmates treated him like a Lippovan. He alleged that while in construction school, after having gone to the administration himself to insist upon being admitted, he was constantly humiliated by his instructors and classmates.\nThe claimant alleged that he became a Pentecostal at the age of 17 years and claimed to have been baptized on XXXXX, 1995. He claimed that everyone rejected him. He testified that he was arrested by police on three separate occasions and that on one occasion, he was taken to the police station because some windows had been broken at the church and he was suspected of having done it. In 1996, a construction company hired him, and he alleged that the ill treatment continued.\nThe claimant performed his military service between XXXXX 1998 and XXXXX 1999, when he was 20 years old. He alleged that he was blamed for everything that went wrong. Upon completing his military service, he returned to work for the same construction company for two months, then worked for a private company for one year.\nOn XXXXX, 2000, the claimant left Romania to go to work in Italy. He alleged that Italy does not provide refugee protection. He had to leave the country in the 15 days following his arrest, after he had lived there for nine months. He arrived in Canada on July 25, 2001.\nDue to the \"Emergency Ordinance law,\" the claimant alleged he would be imprisoned upon his return to Romania because he has been outside of the country since XXXXX 2000.\nDECISION\nThe panel finds that the claimant's fear of being persecuted by reason of his nationality and religion is not well founded, and further finds that the claimant would not be subject personally to a danger of torture, to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment should he have to return to Romania.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\nThe panel finds that the claimant has established his identity as a Romanian national by submitting a copy of his passport issued XXXXX, 2000.\nCredibility\nWhen asked to explain why he had not mentioned in his PIF the incident in which he was accused of breaking the church windows, he replied that he could have written a book about his adventures and that he was there to provide explanations. However, the PIF clearly instructs claimants to relate, in chronological order, all the events that have lead to their claim for refugee protection; this has damaged the claimant's credibility.\nWhen asked to explain the certificate1 indicating that he was a member of the Orthodox Church, he replied that it was issued following his arrival in Canada and that his mother had obtained it from the priest, as she herself was orthodox. He alleged that he did not want to mention that he was a member of the Pentecostal Church on the boat because he was afraid. When asked why he had not obtained a certificate from the Pentecostal Church as he had from the Orthodox Church, he explained that he tried once to contact the priest and was unsuccessful, and he added, his mother was sick. This is not a satisfactory explanation and does not really explain why the claimant obtained a certificate from the Orthodox Church and not the Pentecostal Church. The panel does not believe that the claimant was a practising adherent of the Pentecostal religion when he lived in Romania.\nThe claimant alleged he did not know that there was alternative military service in Romania, and he said his brother had told him that he had to do his military service. He testified that he did not seek to inform himself of the alternatives. According to the documentary evidence,2 there is alternative service in Romania. The panel finds it implausible that the claimant, who claimed to be Pentecostal, would not explore the possibility of alternative service, or that the religious leaders would not inform young followers of alternative service. This reinforces the panel's conclusion that the claimant did not practise the Pentecostal religion while he lived in Romania.\nThe claimant, who left Romania in XXXXX 2000 and spent nine months in Italy, could not satisfactorily explain to the panel why he had not claimed refugee status upon his arrival in Italy, especially considering that he said he had walked 600 kilometers to get there. He alleged that members of the church had told him it was possible to obtain documents in Italy, but once he got there, Romanians told him it was no longer possible. The panel finds that the fact that the claimant did not claim refugee status upon his arrival in Italy after walking 600 kilometers, as he alleged, is inconsistent with any subjective fear. The panel is of the opinion that the claimant should have claimed refugee status upon his arrival in Italy, as it is a country that is a signatory to the Convention.\nThe claimant, who testified that his classmates knew he was Lippovan because of his accent, was asked to comment on the following report:3\n\"The Research Directorate found no reports of either mistreatment or discrimination against Lippovan Romanians among the sources consulted. The editor of the Zorile Review of the Union of Lipovan Russians of Romania was reported to have declared in 1999 that she did not \"feel like a person belonging to a minority\" and that she felt she had integrated into Romanian society (Rompres, 5 July 1999). A Romanian government report on national minority education noted that Russian-language education had been provided to 1,630 Lippovan students in 1999\/2000 and that 29 teachers had taught the language (2001, 69).\"\nThe claimant replied that this report was not true, that he had been a victim of persecution throughout his entire life and that Romania wanted to put its best foot forward in order to be admitted into the European Union. The panel gives more weight to the objective sources consulted by the research centre and listed in its report and considers that the editor would have noted cases of discrimination if she had witnessed or been informed of them. It is interesting to note that upon his arrival, the claimant did not state that he was of Lippovan nationality because, he said, he was afraid, which is implausible, considering that he was claiming protection in Canada. The panel does not believe that the claimant is of this nationality.\nPossibility of Imprisonment Upon Return\nCounsel for the claimant referred in his submissions to Emergency Ordinance\nNo. 112\/2001, in respect of which the evidence on the record states the following:4\n\"...the Romanian government adopted the Emergency Ordinance No. 112\/2001 on 30 August 2001 to curb illegal emigration (Roma Rights 18 Dec. 2001):\nThe ordinance stipulates [penalties of] three months to two years in prison for any Romanian citizen or stateless person who lives in Romania and enters or leaves a foreign state illegally. In case this person does so in order to avoid a punishment, the imprisonment period increases to six months to three years (Mediafax News Agency 3 Oct. 2001).\"\nThe issue to be determined is whether the application of this law constitutes persecution based on one of the Convention grounds, whether the penalty that is provided for and imposed by Romania is disproportionate to the offence and whether it amounts to torture or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nAs stated by Marceau J. in Valentin:5\n\"Neither the international Convention nor our Act, which is based on it, as\nI understand it, had in mind the protection of people who, having been subjected to no persecution to date, themselves created a cause to fear persecution by freely, of their own accord and with no reason, making themselves liable to punishment for violating a criminal law of general application. I would add [...] that the idea does not appear to me even to be supported by the fact that the transgression was motivated by some dissatisfaction of a political nature [...] because it seems to me, first, that an isolated sentence can only in very exceptional cases satisfy the element of repetition and relentlessness found at the heart of persecution [...] but particularly because the direct relationship that is required between the sentence incurred and imposed and the offender's political opinion does not exist.\"\nIn Zolfagharkhani,6 the Federal Court of Appeal reiterated the principle that \"ordinary laws of general application are presumed to be valid and neutral and that the applicant must show that the law in question is persecutory in relation to a Convention ground.\"\nSince, as mentioned previously, the panel does not believe that the claimant is an adherent of the Pentecostal religion or is of Lippovan nationality, the panel finds that the claimant would not be subject to persecution based on one of the Convention grounds. Furthermore, this law applies to all Romanians without exception.\nThe documentary evidence7 states that agreements dealing with return have been concluded between certain countries and Romania. It does not indicate that Romanians, who returned to their country after legislation was put in place, were incarcerated upon their return. It does report that Romanians who were living in Germany objected to being detained at the airport and wanted only to return to Germany. The following information is also given: \"No other reports discussing the treatment of Romanians in detention, or the charges against them, could be found among the sources consulted by the Research Directorate.\"\nIt is reasonable to infer that if the application of the law involved the incarceration of Romanians upon their return to Romania, that fact would be mentioned in the documentary evidence. The panel also finds, based on the evidence available to it, that the law is not currently applied in Romania, and that even if it were, there is no evidence before the panel that would allow it to consider the penalty that could hypothetically be imposed on the claimant to be disproportionate to the offence.\nWith respect to the grounds of protection within the meaning of paragraphs 97(1)(a) and (b), the issue to be determined is whether the claimant, if he were to be detained upon his return for illegally exiting the country, would face a legitimate sanction. Even if the claimant were to face imprisonment, the panel finds that this penalty would be the result of the non-discriminatory application of a general law and would not constitute torture or be \"cruel and unusual\". In Suresh,8 the Supreme Court indicated that torture constitutes cruel and unusual treatment or punishment when it \"is so excessive as to outrage standards of decency.\" This definitely does not apply to the claimant's situation.\nRomanian legislation provides for a prison sentence of three months to two years. Marceau J.,9 commenting on Czech criminal legislation, which provided for a prison sentence of between six months and five years for anyone who overstayed their right of exit, states:\n\"The problem appears to me to be the same for all cases where the legislation of a State provides severe punishment for those of its nationals who leave the territory in an irregular manner or remain abroad beyond the time authorized.\nI will say, first, that while in humanitarian terms I am very much inclined to sympathize with the idea of granting refugee status to everyone who faces criminal sanctions such as those imposed by section 109 of the Czech Criminal Code, in practical and legal terms the idea seems to me to be illogical and without any rational basis.\"\nIn addition, he states that the intention of the international Convention was not to protect people who put themselves in punitive situations.\nThe panel, in light of the cited jurisprudence and the evidence on the record, finds that the sentence of three months to two years is not so excessive as to outrage the standards of decency.\nConcerning prison conditions in Romania, it is certainly believable that they differ from those in Canada. However, the following is indicated in the documentary evidence:10\n\"The prisons system has been considerably improved through the establishment and observance of a clear methodology for the organisation of the detainees' lives and activities.\"\nPoor detention conditions are improving and the budget has been increased, but overpopulation remains a serious problem. Alternative sentences for minor crimes are provided for in order to alleviate overpopulation, and vocational training programs have been set up to facilitate the reintegration of offenders into society.\nThe panel finds that these prison conditions do not amount to persecution, torture, or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. My colleague, member Nuenfeldt,11 in a decision involving a young man of Chinese nationality, stated that detention conditions in China are not the same as those that exist in Canada. He found that the claimant would be incarcerated for having contravened a law of general application. He wrote that in the opinion of the panel, the penalties were inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions under Chinese law.\nThe panel applies the same reasoning: In the case of the claimant, the penalty in question is inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions under Romanian law.\nCONCLUSION\nIn light of this analysis, I have determined that the refugee protection claimant,\nXXXXXXXXX, is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. I therefore reject his claim for refugee protection.\n\"Nycole Roy\"\nNycole Roy\nDated at Ottawa this 21st day of May 2003.\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - RELIGION - ETHNIC PERSECUTION - CREDIBILITY - ILLEGAL EXIT - LAW OF GENERAL APPLICATION - CRUEL AND UNUSUAL TREATMENT OR PUNISHMENT - TORTURE - PRISONERS - LAWFUL SANCTIONS - MALE - NEGATIVE - ROMANIA\n1 Exhibit C2, Certificate from the Orthodox Church.\n2 Exhibit R2)1, Refugee Documentation Centre (Ireland), 2002, Pentecostals in Romania.\n3 Exhibit R3, Response to Information Request ROM41054.E, February 19, 2003.\n4 Exhibit R2)5, Response to Information Request ROM40416.E, November 21, 2002.\n5 Court of Appeal - Valentin v.

His XXXXX have been XXXXXX in prominent XXXXXXXXX such as XXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXXX and the XXXXXXXXXXXXXX. In XXXX, he won XX X and XXXX place at a XXXXXXXX held by XXXXXXXXXXX in Cambodia.\nHe alleged that the Communist government repeatedly warned him1 to stop XXXXXX or XXXXXXX that they consider to be discrediting Cambodia's dictatorial regime, but he could not stop his activity because he \"wanted to reveal the truth to the public.\" For his security he \"had to move from place to place.\" He would stay with his brothers, sister, or mother.\nThe Cambodian government selected him to be a part of the Cambodian team to participate in the XXXXX in XXXX in XXXX 2001. The claimant asserted that Minister of Information Loy Lay Sreng warned him two weeks before his departure to not XXXX in Canada XXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXX XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXX XXXXX these could discredit Prime Minister Hun Sen.\nIn XXXX, on XXXXX, 2001, the claimant displayed XXXXX at the XXXXXXXX. One of these XXX XXXXX XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXX XXXXX XX XXXXXXXXX XXX. The claimant testified that the Cambodian delegation head confiscated his passport and travelling documents on the XXXXX 2001 and told him that he would inform the Cambodian government about the XXXXX so that they could take action against him. The claimant was panic-stricken. He felt that he would suffer the fate of XXXX who were killed because their XXXXXXX criticized Hun Sen's government. The claimant applied for refugee status in Canada.\nDETERMINATION\nI find the claimant not to be a Convention refugee in that there is no more than a mere possibility of his facing persecution in Cambodia on a Convention ground, namely imputed political opinion. I also find that the claimant is not a person in need of protection in that his removal to Cambodia would not subject him personally to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment and in that there are no substantial grounds to believe that his removal to Cambodia would subject him personally to a danger of torture.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\nOn the basis of his documents2 such as Cambodian national ID card and his participation in the XXXXXXX in XXXX as a member of the Cambodian delegation, I find the claimant to be a citizen of Cambodia.\nCredibility\nHowever, I find that key aspects of his claim are not credible, trustworthy or reliable and that his fear of return to his country is not well founded.\nHis claim is based primarily on his XXXXXXX in XXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX, and his assertion that the head of the Cambodian delegation confiscated his passport and travel documents and told him that he would report this to the government for action. The claimant stated that he feared being killed, like those XXXXXXXX who had criticized Hun Sen.\nI do not find this testimony credible. First of all, the XXXXX that the claimant XXXXX in XXXXX was not a new one. The claimant had sold copies of that XXXXX to prominent XXXXXX many years ago. That XXXXX was published in XXXXX on the XXXX of XXXXX, an XXXXXXXX of peace initiatives. It clearly identified the claimant as the XXXXX XXXXX XXXXXX. It carried the full story of what the XXXX was all about. The XXXXX of this XXXXX overseas did not cause the claimant any problem in Cambodia in the last four years. It is reasonable to infer that, this being so, the claimant would not now face problems for XXXXXXXXX that has been widely circulated years ago.\nThe claimant has also had his XXXXXXXX regularly in renowned XXXXXXXX like XXXXXXXXX and others. The claimant explained: \"I have been sending these XXXXXX and they are being XXXXXX overseas, but the government does not know about it.\"\nI find this explanation implausible. The claimant is one of Cambodia's most XXXXXXXXX. He is accredited to the Cambodian government as a XXXXXXXX. He has a XXXXXX.3 His XXXXXX which were XXXXX in foreign countries included XXXXXXX of the XXXXXXXX of Prime Minister Hun Sen, who was reportedly slain on the order of Hun Sen's XXXXX. It is implausible that the Cambodian government, with a Ministry of Information and a Minister, did not know about the XXXXXX of his XXXXX overseas. The claimant also was XXXXXXXXX for XXXXXXX and XXXXXX till his departure from Cambodia.\nThe claimant testified that the Information Minister told him before his departure for the XXXXXXXXX in XXXXXXX not to XXXXXXX that XXXXXXX killings and this would discredit the Prime Minister. I find this to be an embellishment. The government of Cambodia had itself selected the claimant to be a member of the national team. If the government feared that he would XXXXXXXX in Canada that would embarrass them it is reasonable to infer that it would not have selected him on its national team.\nMoreover, the XXXXXX and XXXXXXX, which XXXX his XXXXX in other countries, were mailed to him in Cambodia. The claimant had written4 in his narrative: \"The current communist authorities repeatedly warned me to stop XXXXX or XXXXXXXXX which they considered to be discrediting the dictatorial regime, but as a XXXXXXXXXX and XXXXX, I couldn't stop my activity because I wanted to reveal the truth to the public.\"\nThis clearly shows that the government was familiar with the nature of the XXXXXXX that the claimant had been taking in his professional capacity for XXXXXXX in Cambodia and other countries.\nQuestioned at his hearing to explain the warnings from the government that he had written about in his narrative the claimant testified that the authorities never warned him directly to stop XXXXX XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXX. He said that he was referring to a general warning that had been given by the government to the heads of all the XXXXX in Cambodia. He testified that his bosses in the XXXXXXX where he worked told him about the kinds of XXXX they will XXXXXXX and those that they will not XXXXX. The claimant said that the authorities had never warned him directly even once during the many years that he was taking XXXXX for XXXXX in Cambodia and overseas. This was his explanation for his writing in his narrative that the authorities had repeatedly warned him not to XXXXXX critical of the government.\nThe claimant had also written in his narrative that for his personal security he had to move from place to place. This is implausible because the claimant had never been arrested or even warned by the government about his XXXXXXX and there is no evidence that he faced any threat from the government. Asked to explain this statement at his hearing the claimant said that the government knew where he worked (from XXXX to XXXX in XXX and from XXXX to XXXX also for XXXXXXXXXX) and that, if it wanted to arrest him, it could have easily done so. He said: \"If the government wanted to arrest me, they could have done so.\"\nI find that his statement in his Personal Information Form narrative that the government warned him not to XXXXXXXX critical of the government (he testified at his hearing that the authorities did not warn him even once) and that he went into hiding as a result are simply embellishments for the purpose of this refugee protection claim. There is no evidence that he had any reason to go into hiding. If he had done so, it would have served no purpose because he testified that the government knew where he worked and could have arrested him if it wanted. It made no effort to do so.\nThe claimant wrote in his narrative about the Minister of Information warning him not to XXXXX showing the killing of innocent people, XXXXXXXX and demonstrators. The claimant said that he XXXXXXXX, and three others, because they XXXXX no killings or violence and so he was not violating the instructions of the Information Minister.\nEven if we believe that the head of the Cambodian delegation warned the claimant that he will report about this XXXXX to the government, it is reasonable to infer that this would not cause the claimant any problems. As he testified, the XXXXX he XXXXX did not XXXXX killings or violence. Further, the XXXX in question has been XXXXX prominently abroad without the government having taken any action against the claimant. So why would it take any action against him now?\nThe claimant provided no explanation for why the government would take action against him now, except to say that it did not take action earlier because it did not know that his XXXXX critical of the government were being XXXXX overseas. I just don't accept this explanation as plausible for the reasons explained above.\nThe claimant had written in his narrative that he became \"very panic-stricken\" and that he knew that he would suffer the same fate as other XXXXX who were killed because they XXXXXXX criticizing the Hun Sen government. We asked the claimant who were the XXXXXX who had been killed by the government for criticising the government. The claimant said: \"I knew a few who have been shot on the ground of politics\". He was asked to give names and to tell the panel about what the XXXXXXX said. The claimant said that he knows that one XXXXXXXX named XXXXXXX something about corruption in 2000 and was shot by someone but that the government claimed that he killed himself.\nThe claimant could provide no details about XXXX, the name of his XXXXXXX, the contents of what he XXXXXXXX, the circumstances of his death or any subsequent information about how he died. The claimant offered no explanation. He had no knowledge.\nI find this also to be an embellishment because the information is so sketchy. I don't find this testimony to be reliable or in any way linked to the claimant's situation.\nFurthermore, the claimant came to Canada on a legal passport as a member of the Cambodian delegation. The government selected him. As explained above, I find that the government obviously knew about his work as a XXXXX. Previously he had gone to Malaysia, Thailand, China and France in connection with his XXXXXX work or for training on a Cambodian passport and returned to the country without getting into any difficulty, despite the XXXXX overseas of his XXXXXX that were critical of the government.\nI also find that the documentary evidence does not support the claimant's allegations. The United States State Department Report5 2001 states that \"the Constitution provides for freedom of expression, press and publication, and the government generally respects these rights in practice. There continue to be some problems. The Constitution provides XXXX with a number of rights, including a prohibition of XXXXXXX censorship and protection from imprisonment for expressing opinions. However, the XXXXXXX law also includes a vaguely worded prohibition on XXXXXXX that affect national security and political stability. There is no report that XXXXXXXX practice censorship. There were a large number of XXXXXX critical of the government, which included frequent highly personal criticism of the Prime Minister, the President of the National Assembly and other senior officials. There were approximately XXX Khmer-language XXXXXXXX regularly. Of these XXX were considered to be pro-government; XXXX were considered to support the opposition Sam Rainsy party (SRP), XXXX was considered to support the FUNCINPEC party and XXXX was considered to be anti-monarchy. In addition, there was one French language XXXX, one English language XXXXX, and two other English XXXXX. Although the two largest XXXXX are considered pro-government, most XXXXX criticise the government frequently, and Prime Minister Hun Sen and National Assembly President Prince Norodom Ranariddh frequently came under strong attack by opposition XXXXXXXX. During the year, there were no clear instances of government intimidation or retribution against XXXXXXXXX critical of the government.\"\nAsked to respond, the claimant repeated what he had previously said, that the government kills opposition XXXXXX who criticize the government.\nThe claimant was also confronted with other documentary evidence6. These do not state that any XXXXXXXX was killed for criticizing the government but these reports stated that XXXXXXX were charged with terrorism in 2001 after their names were found on a list\nwritten by an alleged terrorist and that XXXXXXX were fined after they were sued by the Foreign Minister for XXXXXXXX that he had run a Khmer Rouge prison camp. The claimant had no response to these reports.\nCONCLUSION\nSo for all these reasons I find that the claimant XXXXXXXXXX is not a Convention refugee. There is no more than a mere possibility of his facing persecution on a Convention ground if he were to return to Cambodia. I also find for the same reasons that the claimant is not a person in need of protection in that his removal to Cambodia would not subject him personally to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment and in that there are no substantial grounds to believe that his removal to Cambodia would subject him personally to a danger of torture. I therefore reject his claim.\n\"Azhar Ali Khan\"\nAzhar Ali Khan\nDated at Ottawa this 12th day of March, 2003.\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - POLITICAL OPINION - CREDIBILITY - MALE - NEGATIVE - CAMBODIA\n1 C-1, Personal Information Form narrative\n2 C-2, photocopies of identity card, diploma, XXXXXX and other documents\n3 C-2\n4 C-1, Personal Information Form narrative\n5 R-1, Tab-1, U.S. State Department Report\n6 R-1, Tab-7 (Committee to XXXXXXX report for 2001) , Tab-8 (XXXXXXXX report for 2001)\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRPD File # \/ No. dossier SPR : ___________\n1\nRPD File # \/ No. dossier SPR : AA1-01014\n8\n",

The claimant further claims that he would be at risk of torture were he to return to Morocco as he has experienced torture in the past.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant asserts that he is from the Western Sahara and that the invasion of the territory of the Western Sahara in 1975 has caused great suffering for the people of the Western Sahara, that they are second-class citizens in their own country, and that they are denied their rights to speak and seek political freedom.\nThe claimant asserts that in 1995 at age 24, he received a notice to report for military service. He did not respond and in essence he ran away and hid. He received another notice which was delivered to his parents' address and again he did not respond to this notice. The claimant asserts that his mother was picked up for questioning about his whereabouts and then when the claimant eventually realized that his mother was being held by the police, he voluntarily surrendered to the military in 1997. His Personal Information Form did not have a more precise date. During his testimony, when he was asked for a date, he believed it to be XXXX or XXXX 1997.\nThe claimant asserts that he acted insane and also faked a blackout during his 24 hours of mistreatment at the military barracks. He asserts that he sustained an injury to his right knee and his foot and that after he pretended to blackout, he was taken to the hospital where he was treated\nfor 10 days. When he was released he was warned not to report the torture that he had sustained. The claimant never received any further call up notices and was not required to perform any other military service.\nThe claimant joined a Western Sahara XXXX group in 1997. He regarded this as his way of being able to affect his escape from Morocco. In 1999, the claimant, along with approximately 28 others, went from Morocco across to an island in Spain. The claimant was detained on arrival, taken to court and eventually was expelled from Spain. He did not make a refugee claim at this time.\nOn arrival back in Morocco, the claimant was not detained or mistreated or suffer any other consequences for having tried to escape to Spain. The claimant asserts that the authorities wanted to present a positive image with regard to the treatment of the people of the Western Sahara in order that they would vote with Morocco in the referendum regarding the future of the Western Sahara.\nIn XXXX 2001, the claimant went to Germany as part of a Western Sahara XXXXXX XXXXX. He was there for approximately five days. He asserts that he thought of making a claim, but was never free to do so and he did not have his passport in his possession.\nThe claimant arrived in Canada with the XXXXXXX as part of the XXXXXXXXXX. He arrived in Canada on the 12th of July 2001 and made his refugee claim on the 2nd of August 2001.\nThe claimant asserts that he also faces a risk of torture in Morocco as a member of a tribe from the Western Sahara and because he has made a refugee claim in Canada.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\nThe claimant's personal and citizenship identity are established by the copies of his identity card and his passport, the originals of which are in the possession of Immigration. The panel accepts these documents as credible and that he has established that he is who he says he is and that he is a citizen of Morocco.\nCredibility\nThe claimant in his Personal Information Form says \"I am from Western Sahara\". In his oral testimony, he stated quite clearly at the outset \"I was born in Western Sahara\". In his Personal Information Form he states he was born in Guelmin. It was pointed out to the claimant that the map1 shows clearly that Guelmin is well within the territory of Morocco. It is not in the disputed territory of Western Sahara.\nThe claimant explained this contradiction by saying that Guelmin is the gateway to the Western Sahara. The panel does not accept this explanation as credible. Guelmin is 150 kilometres from the disputed territory. The panel finds the claimant's evidence to have been exaggerated in his Personal Information Form and in his oral testimony regarding coming from the Western Sahara.\nThe claimant asserts that he is tribally connected to the Western Sahara because his family tribe is originally from the area that is now in the disputed territory. While the panel accepts that the claimant's grandfather may have been born in what is now the disputed territory, the claimant's father was born in Morocco and the claimant was born in Morocco. Therefore, the claimant is clearly a citizen of Morocco and while he may be ethnically of a tribe originally\nfrom the Western Sahara, he is not similarly situated to those individuals who are from the Western Sahara and whose identity cards clearly identify them as being from the Western Sahara.\nThe panel therefore finds insufficient credible evidence that the claimant is from the Western Sahara or is in fact perceived to be from the Western Sahara.\nThe claimant in his oral evidence and in his Personal Information Form has made no claim to any involvement with the Polissario or any other entity which is advocating for the rights of those of the Western Sahara. The panel therefore finds insufficient credible evidence that the claimant is perceived to have a political opinion by the authorities in Morocco, given that he is engaged in no activities in support of the human rights or political rights of the people of the Western Sahara.\nThe claimant asserts that he was called up for military service in 1995, which would have made him well past the age of 18. He claims he did not respond to these notices and that he had to be in hiding. The claimant, when asked if he could be more specific about the date he surrendered himself, initially could not remember. When pressed as to why he could not be more specific, he eventually stated he thought it would be XXXX or XXXX 1997.\nThe panel finds that it is not credible that the claimant would not remember the date that he surrendered himself to the military in order to have his mother released. The panel finds it to be reasonable to expect that such a significant event as surrendering to authorities after being in hiding for two years would be something that the claimant would more easily remember.\nThe claimant presented a brief medical note from a doctor in Canada indicating that he has an injury to his foot, consistent with a beating. The panel accepts this note as indicating that there is an injury to the foot, but given the lack of detail in the medical note and any explanation as to how the doctor could assess how this injury was caused, simply saying it's consistent with a beating is not sufficient credible evidence of how the injury was sustained.\nThe panel does not believe that the claimant was detained in 1997. The claimant asserts that he was being sought by the authorities from 1995 when he went into hiding until XXXXXX 1997. However, the claimant's passport clearly indicates that it was issued on the XXXXX 1997. During questionning the claimant gave evidence that this was a legally issued passport applied for by him in the usual fashion. The panel does not find it plausible that the claimant, if he was in hiding because of wanting to avoid reporting for military service, would put himself in the vulnerable position of applying to the Moroccan authorities for a passport with the intention of leaving the country.\nThe fact that the claimant was issued a passport on the XXXXX 1997 leads the panel to believe that the claimant was not being sought. The documentary evidence2 indicates that the Moroccan constitution provides for freedom of movement. However, the government restricts this right in certain circumstances.\n\"The Ministry of the Interior restricts freedom to travel outside the country in certain circumstances. In addition, all civil servants and military personnel must obtain written permission to leave the country and there are compiled lists of individuals who reportedly have been denied passports or who have passports but are denied permission to travel.\"\nIt seems reasonable to assume that someone who has not performed his military service and who is being actively sought by the Moroccan authorities would not be issued a passport. Despite the claimant's assertion that he paid a bribe to have his passport application processed more quickly, there is no reason to believe that it is other than a genuine passport. The issuance of this passport leads the panel to believe that the claimant was not being sought for his military service in XXXXX 1997, which then calls into question the credibility of the claimant's account of his mistreatment in XXXX or XXXX 1997. The panel does not believe he was detained.\nThe claimant, along with 40 others, was returned to Morocco by Spain after making an attempt to enter Spain illegally. The Moroccan authorities detained everyone except the claimant when they arrived back from Spain. The claimant asserts that it was because he was from the Western Sahara and that they were anxious not to have the people of the Western Sahara think badly of them in preparation for the referendum.\nThe evidence clearly indicates that the claimant being deported from Spain as an illegal experienced no problems on return to Morocco in 1999.\nThe claimant asserts that he faces possible torture on return to Morocco. The panel finds insufficient credible evidence to support this assertion. He was returned from Spain and he suffered no consequences whatsoever. The authorities of Morocco know that the claimant did not return from Canada with the XXXXXX. However, given the evidence of his treatment on his return from Spain, the panel finds insufficient evidence to support the assertion that the claimant would face other than the same treatment on his return from Canada after having failed to return with his XXXXX.\nThe claimant asserts that he was reluctant to make his claim on arrival in Canada for several reasons, the main one being that he did not have his passport in his possession and that he was afraid for his family. The claimant had his passport with him about 15 days after being in Canada. His reason for not making his claim as soon as he had his passport then was that he was afraid for his family. He asserts that making a claim while the XXXX was still in Canada could have put his family at risk.\nCounsel submitted that the claimant making his claim before the XXXX had performed their commitment in Canada would be more embarrassing to the government of Morocco. The panel accepts that this is a plausible reason for the delay in making the claim. However, there is no evidence that there have been any reprisals taken against the claimant's family as a consequence of him having remained in Canada. The panel finds this to be further evidence of a lack of interest in the claimant by the Moroccan authorities.\nThe claimant in his oral evidence stated that the Moroccan government had created a positive atmosphere in Morocco for those people who are ethnically connected to the Western Sahara because of the ongoing discussions about the future of the Western Sahara and the upcoming referendum.\nThe panel finds the claimant's evidence to be internally inconsistent. His Personal Information Form indicates that he is very scared to return to Morocco. He asserts he is afraid the government will persecute him or see him as a scapegoat because he did not return and he does not want to be a person who has to hide his beliefs and feelings in his country.\nThis is at odds with the claimant's statements that the government of Morocco has created a good atmosphere and that in fact they did not punish him in any way for having tried to illegally enter Spain or for having been returned by Spain to Morocco. The claimant was allowed to represent Morocco on two occasions, once to Germany and once to Canada, after he had been returned by Spain. The claimant never satisfactorily resolved this contradictory evidence and the panel finds it to be not credible.\nThe panel has reviewed the documentary evidence and finds that there is insufficient evidence to objectively support the claimant's assertions that he would face a risk were he to be returned to Morocco based on his ethnic origin. The documentary evidence indicates that there is no ongoing active conflict involving the Moroccan forces and therefore the panel finds insufficient evidence to support the assertion that the claimant would be at risk of ever being called up for military service were he to return to Morocco.\nThe claimant has had no political involvement on the issue of the Western Sahara and the panel finds all of the evidence to lead to a finding that no political opinion has been imputed to the claimant. The panel finds that the claimant is not similarly situated to those people who have been mistreated by the Moroccan state as a consequence of being involved in or being perceived to be involved in issues of independence for the Western Sahara.\nThere is insufficient credible evidence that the claimant would face persecution were he to return to Morocco as a failed refugee claimant. His treatment in the past is evidence that supports this finding and there is nothing in the documentary evidence to support the assertion that purely being a failed claimant would cause him to be at risk of persecution.\nFor all these reasons, the panel finds insufficient credible evidence to support the assertion that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution in Morocco for any ground in the definition of a Convention refugee.\nDETERMINATION\nThe panel therefore finds that XXXXXXX is not a Convention refugee. In light of the credibility findings, the panel further finds that the claimant is not a person in need of protection in that his removal to Morocco would not subject him personally to a risk of torture or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or to a risk to his life. I therefore reject his claim.\n\"Eunice Harker\"\nEunice Harker\nDated at Ottawa this 30th day of May 2003.\n1 Exhibit R-3\n2 Department of State Report for 2001, issued in 2002, page 14.\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRPD File # \/ No. dossier SPR : ___________\n1\nRPD File # \/ No. dossier SPR : AA1-01039\n1\n",

The claimant is a twenty-six-year-old, single male who claims a well-founded fear of persecution based on his political opinion, namely his membership and involvement with the Democratic Party in Albania.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant alleges that his father has been a prominent member of the Democratic Party(DP) since the early 1990's and consequently the claimant became politicized at an early age. He began attending DP meetings with his father and became very active in the party. His father held elected office in the party in their district.\nDuring the 1997 elections the claimant asserts that armed supporters of the Socialist Party tried to steal the ballot boxes and threatened to kill the claimant and other DP members. During the fight the claimant was beaten. The police came, broke up the fight, asked some questions, encouraged everyone to leave and then left. As the Socialist Party won the election the claimant asserts that his father resigned from his position because he was discouraged about corruption in the government.\nThe claimant asserts that there were death threats against him after the 1997 incident, but he continued with his activities on behalf of the DP. When the 2001 elections were called the claimant campaigned for the DP but was asked to observe the voting on behalf of the Legality Party at the polling station in his area as at that time the two parties were in the Union for Victory coalition.\nHe asserts that there was an incident at the polling station involving a group of armed men who burst in and attempted to steal the ballot boxes. The claimant asserts that one of the men, who was the same man as had threatened him in 1997, held a gun to his head and threatened to kill him if he did not leave the Democratic Party. The claimant asserts that there were serious election irregularities resulting in DP votes being lost in his area.\nThe claimant alleges that as his life was threatened by armed men who came to the family home when the claimant was not there, the claimant's father decided that the claimant should leave the country for his own safety. The claimant went to the capital and made arrangements to leave.\nThe claimant traveled through Italy and France without making a refugee claim in either place. He arrived in Montreal on 14 August 2001 and made his refugee claim in Halifax on 20 August 2001.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\nRegarding identity the claimant presented no passport, having traveled on a false passport. The birth certificate1 that the claimant provided is an original and was presented for the purposes of establishing his personal identity, country of birth and therefore citizenship. The panel accepts the birth certificate as establishing the claimant's personal identity and his citizenship as Albanian. However there were problems in the claimant's evidence surrounding the date of issue of the birth certificate which is dealt with in detail later in these reasons.\nCredibility\nThe panel has found the claimant's evidence to be so lacking in credibility that it found insufficient credible evidence to establish a well-founded fear of persecution in Albania on any ground in the definition of a Convention refugee for the following reasons.\nDocuments\nThe claimant presented a number of documents in support of his claim. However, there were contradictions between the claimant's oral evidence and the documents and these were not satisfactorily explained. Further the documents themselves were in many cases not originals but only photocopies, without a reasonable explanation as to why the originals were not available, and consequently the panel could give little or no probative value to the documents that were not originals as outlined in detail below.\nRegarding membership in the Democratic Party, the panel notes problems with the claimant's evidence regarding his membership card such that the panel cannot find sufficient credible evidence that he was a D.P. member.\nThe claimant did not present his original membership card, only a photocopy2 and his explanation was that he was afraid that it could be lost in the mail and therefore did not want to risk having it sent.\nThe panel does not find the claimant's explanation of why he did not have his original card sent to him to be credible. The panel can find no reasonable explanation as to what use it could be to the claimant in Albania. Further, the panel finds the claimant failed to attempt to find an alternative secure method of transporting it if he did not trust the mail, such as a courier company.\nThe panel therefore draws an adverse inference from the lack of the original DP membership card.\nWhen asked if there were differences between the claimant's DP membership card and his father's3 the claimant replied that they were the same. As pointed out by the RPO it is evident on examination of the photocopies, the two cards are clearly not the same. In addition to different information provided on the cards, the father's card, issued in 1991, appears to be a booklet, while the claimant's, issued in 1997, is a single card. The claimant's explanation was that his is also a booklet, but that his father had not opened it when the photocopy was made. The claimant was asked if the format of DP membership cards had changed since his father's card had been issued. He answered that the format changed in 1998, indicating that the format of his card should have been the same as his father's if it were issued in 1997.\nInformation contained in Exhibit R-24 indicates that cards such as the claimant's appears to be have \"been in circulation for about a year and a half.\" Accompanying this report is a copy of the new DP membership card, which appears to be identical to the claimant's. The report states that the previous cards were in the form of six-page booklets that listed the holder's monthly membership payments. This description appears to fit the father's card, although it was issued in 1991 and the report states that these booklets first appeared in 1993. According to this information it does not appear possible that the claimant could have been issued the card submitted as Exhibit C2, Tab 6, in 1997.\nGiven all of this, the panel puts no weight on the claimant's membership card, and finds the claimant to have failed to provide sufficient credible evidence that he was a member of in the DP.\nWith respect to other documents presented there were considerable contradictions between the documents and the claimant's oral evidence.\nThe claimant stated that his birth certificate5 was issued \"a long time\" ago, approximately 2-3 years, and that he had this document before leaving Albania. The date of issue of this document is XXXXX 2001. However the claimant allegedly left Albania on XXXXX 2001.\nWhen asked about the criminal certificate6 the claimant stated that his father had applied for this for him, because he felt that \"as long as his son was at home it was better to have all the certificates\" for him. Although the claimant stated that this certificate was obtained while he was still in Albania, and that he saw it there, the date on the document indicates that it was issued on XXXXX 2001, two months after the claimant had allegedly left his country.\nThe claimant stated that he applied personally for the Attestation of Judicial\nState7. However this document is dated XXXX 2001, again more than two months after the claimant had allegedly departed Albania.\nThe claimant provided a military book8 indicating that he performed his military service in 1995-1996, however contradicting his contention that he received the certificate in 1997, it is dated XXXXX 2001.\nWhen asked to explain this apparent inconsistency the claimant stated that perhaps the translator had made errors and that could be why all the dates were from the same time period. Given that the dates are also clearly visible on the Albanian versions this is regarded as not a reasonable explanation.\nThe question of how he could have had these documents in Albania if they were issued only after his arrival in Canada was put to the claimant, who replied that he was \"never really interested\" in the documents and did not focus on the dates, but he knew that all of the documents were his and had been issued for him. When asked if this was his explanation the claimant said that while he did not remember about these documents because his parents had applied for them, he could verify the military, school and Democratic Party (DP) certificates.\nThe panel does not find the claimant's explanations to satisfactorily explain how he could personally have obtained his military book or the Attestation of Judicial State as he had left Albania before they were issued and finds it can give the documents no weight. The panel does not accept as credible that the claimant had his birth certificate in his possession before he left Albania given the date of issue is after the claimant allegedly left. His evidence is clearly not credible in this regard. In addition, the panel does not accept the claimant's evidence about having seen the criminal certificate before he left Albania as it was clearly issued after he had left the country. His evidence in this regard is not credible.\nTherefore other than accepting his personal identity and his nationality, the panel puts no probative value on the documents presented by the claimant. The panel also finds that this claimant's evidence regarding when he left Albania to be in doubt and will be addressed later in these reasons.\nIncidents\nAt the outset of the hearing the claimant was asked to explain why there were such considerable additions and amendments, submitted 30 October 2002, to his PIF narrative which had been originally submitted on 25 September 2002. After a thorough examination of the process involved in producing the PIF and in hearing the claimant's explanations for the differences, the panel makes the following findings.\nThe initial explanation offered for the extensive additions to the narrative concerning the events on election day in 2001 was that the interpreter and the previous counsel had shortened the version that the claimant had provided in written form in Albanian. However, the claimant admitted during extensive questioning about the process that what was submitted as the narrative to the PIF was prepared by the claimant providing details to the counsel and a translator. The claimant asserted that he later wrote out a more detailed account of events, which was then used as the basis for the amendments submitted.\nThe second version of the events during the election of 2001 contained several additional incidents and with a different sequence of events.\nThe panel accepts that some minor amendments making something more clear than it was in the first version is reasonable. However, given that the claimant had a qualified translator and was assisted by counsel when preparing the first version of his narrative, the panel draws an adverse inference regarding the claimant's credibility because of significant differences in the two versions and a lack of a reasonable explanation.\nThe events surrounding the Election Day and immediately following were the precipitating incidents that caused the claimant to fear for his life and to leave his country. The panel finds it to be only reasonable that the version submitted with his PIF would have been accurate in its basic details and sequence. The visit to the claimant's house by gunmen was not in the first version of the narrative. The account of five armed men entering the polling station and attempting to steal the ballot boxes was not mentioned in the original PIF narrative and neither was mention made of the claimant being hit on the head.\nThe claimant's explanation was that he was not asked about it during his first meeting with the interpreter and the counsel. However, when asked to describe the process, the claimant explained that he was the one providing the details of the events that had happened to him and the panel can find no reasonable explanation as to why he would not have provided those details at the time.\nThe panel finds that the claimant in his expanded PIF was attempting to bolster his claim by adding the additional details of the visit to his house by gunmen and the armed men at the polling station and does not find his evidence to be credible.\nThe major incident which caused the claimant to fear was that which occurred at the polling station. The claimant gave contradictory evidence regarding whether or not he knew the men who burst in. The claimant at the hearing stated that he did not know the man who threatened him with a gun, but that he recognized him from 1997. In the narrative of his PIF concerning the 1997 incident the claimant states \"the city small, and I knew the attackers.\" At one point in his oral evidence regarding the 1997 incident the claimant asserted that the men who burst in wore masks.\nIn his attempt to explain the inherent contradictions in his evidence the claimant stated that the one who hit him in 2001 knew him from 1997. When asked to explain how the man would know the claimant but the claimant would not know him, he tried to clarify further by stating that he recognized the man's face from 1997.\nThe panel finds that the claimant was exaggerating details of the 1997 event by saying that the men were masked and then had to change his testimony to fit his earlier assertion that he knew or recognized the men who threatened him in 2001 as they were the same men as were involved in 1997. The panel further finds that the claimant was exaggerating when he stated he knew his attackers in 1997. The panel finds his explanations regarding the men who allegedly threatened him at the polling station of 2001, and any connection to the men who disrupted the voting in 1997 to be unsatisfactory. The panel does not find his evidence in this regard to be credible.\nCounsel submits that in Albania, insulting someone can result in being hounded until he is killed. The claimant in his narrative asserts that he was threatened with death after the 1997 election incident and that his father had advised him then to leave the country.\nYet the claimant reports no attempts on his life between 1997 and the events of XXXXX 2001. He was allegedly active openly on behalf of the DP, even going to schools. The panel finds it difficult to believe that if the claimant had been seriously threatened in 1997 with death threats, he would either not have fled the country at that time or would not have seriously curtailed his activities.\nThe documentary evidence reveals that those who are involved in blood feuds live in self-imposed house arrest. The claimant did not behave in this fashion. The panel therefore finds it to be not credible that the claimant was threatened in 1997.\nIn examining the documentary evidence regarding the elections in Albania in 2001, the panel notes that there were a significant number of election monitoring personnel throughout Albania and very detailed reporting of election irregularities. The panel notes that these reports contain details of irregularities in various parts of the country, some were serious incidents, but there were also reports of very minor incidents. There were a significant number of election monitors in the claimant's city of XXXXX and it was one of the cities with particular concern being paid to it. There is no mention in the documentary evidence of any report of attempts to steal ballot boxes in a polling station in XXXXX.\nThe claimant asserts that there were no outside organisations as monitors in his polling station and that this is the reason why there is no mention in the documentary evidence of the incident he describes. The panel does not find the claimant's assertion to be credible. Given the number and extent of detailed reports of voting irregularities that are of much less significance than an attempt to steal ballot boxes at gunpoint, the panel finds it to be reasonable to believe that an attempt to steal a ballot box by armed gunmen in a polling station in XXXXX would have been reported. Even if there were no actual outside monitors at that polling station the panel finds it to be reasonable that such a serious irregularity would on a balance of probabilities have been reported. The panel prefers the documentary evidence to that of the claimant. The absence of any mention of the incident in the documentary evidence leads the panel to conclude on a balance of probabilities that it did not occur.\nPolitical Activity\nThe claimant asserted that he was asked to be a monitor for the Legality Party during the voting in 2001 despite not having any previous connection to the party. Part of his function was to take people to meet the leader of the Party. When asked about the Legality Party the claimant described it as a \"leftist\" party. The documentary evidence describes it as a \"centre-right\" party. When confronted with this apparent contradiction the claimant's explanation was that he did not know what their leaning is now. Further the claimant asserted that the DP and Legality Party were in the Union for Victory and that it was a coalition of smaller opposition parties including the Human Rights Union and the Christian Democratic Party. The documentary evidence9 reveals that neither the Human Rights Union nor the Christian Democratic Party belongs to the Union for Victory. In fact the Human Rights Union is a member of the Alliance for State Coalition with the Socialist Party.\nThe panel finds the claimant's evidence not to be credible with regard to his knowledge of the Liberty Party and its philosophy, nor his knowledge of the members of the coalition in Albanian politics. Given the claimant's assertion of his level of political involvement, his activism and his commitment, the panel would expect him to be more knowledgeable about the party for which he was involved in monitoring the voting and to know more accurately which parties were in the various coalitions. The panel does not believe the claimant had any involvement with the Legality Party.\nThe claimant asserted that his father had been a member of the DP since the early 1990's and had even held elected office at one time. There was no evidence presented that the claimant's father had any significant problems as a consequence of his DP involvement.\nThe panel has earlier found the claimant's evidence regarding his membership in the DP not to be credible. However, even if it had been found to be credible, the panel notes that the documentary evidence does not indicate problems amounting to persecution of members of the DP. There is insufficient evidence of discrimination amounting to persecution of members of DP such that the claimant as a similarly situated person would have a well-founded fear of persecution based on political opinion.\nThe claimant asserted that other than at election time his primary involvement for the DP was to organize meetings and to visit schools to talk to students about the DP The claimant asserted that the principals of the state-run schools would permit them to enter the schools to canvass the students about their views of the DP and the Socialist Party.\nCounsel submits that this is plausible because the Socialist Party was not in effective control over the northern region up until 2000 and that the principals would likely have been DP supporters.\nThe documentary evidence does not specifically speak to this issue. However, given all the issues of credibility surrounding the claimant's evidence the panel does not believe the claimant on this issue. The panel does not find it to be reasonable to believe in a state such as Albania, which is very newly democratic and struggling to be so, and without a tradition of tolerance of democratic institutions, that attempts to politicize students for the opposition DP would have been tolerated by the Socialist Party which was the government of the day.\nThe schools were state-controlled and the SP had tenuous control. It does not seem reasonable that they would have tolerated publicly employed principals to be so openly partisan for the opposition by allowing open campaigning for the DP, and open criticism of the government, is its classrooms.\nThe panel does not find this to be plausible in the circumstances of Albania given the tenuous hold on power that the SP had. The panel therefore does not find the claimant's evidence about these activities in support of the DP to be credible.\nSubjective Fear\nThe claimant traveled through Italy and France en route to Canada. He did not make an asylum claim in either of these countries which are signatories to the Convention. His explanation for not doing so was in part that Italy was too close to Albania. He further stated that he was not even interested to find out if it was possible given that his intention was to come to Canada because of its human rights record.\nThe panel does not find it to be behaviour consistent with a fear of persecution that the claimant would not attempt to make an asylum claim in the first country that is a signatory to the Convention.\nHowever, even if his not making a claim in Italy or France was reasonable, the panel finds his testimony regarding his reasons for not making a claim on arrival in Canada to be not credible and exhibiting behaviour inconsistent with a subjective fear. The claimant asserted that his intention on leaving Albania was to claim asylum in Canada. However, he did not make any claim on arrival rather he landed in Montreal and only after coincidentally happening to meet an Albanian speaking person in Montreal who advised him to come to Halifax, he made his claim in Halifax six days later.\nThe claimant asserts that he traveled with another Albanian woman, that she had the false passports, and tickets and that they were lost or stolen in Montreal.\nThe claimant's explanation for the lack of claim on arrival was that they did not know the language and did not know what to do. The panel does not accept this as a reasonable explanation. Refugee claimants frequently make their need for protection known to the first official they encounter in Canada, frequently without any facility in English. The claimant has no way of verifying his entry into Canada or the route he traveled.\nGiven all of the other credibility concerns raised earlier by the claimant's evidence regarding dates on his various documents being issued after he allegedly left his country and his evidence being that he obtained them while in Albania, the panel cannot believe the claimant regarding when he left Albania. The panel does not find the claimant's explanation for not making his claim on arrival to be reasonable. The panel further draws an adverse inference from the fact that he has failed to provide credible evidence regarding his departure from Albania and his arrival in Canada.\nEven is the panel were to believe the dates of departure and arrival, the panel finds his reasons for delay in claiming to be not credible and evidence of behaviour inconsistent with a subjective fear.\nGiven the number of credibility issues raised by the claimant's evidence, the panel finds that he is not a credible witness and that his testimony was wholly unreliable and untrustworthy such that there was insufficient credible evidence to establish a well-founded fear of persecution on any ground in the definition of a Convention refugee.\nDETERMINATION\nFor all these reasons, I find XXXXXXXXX not to be a Convention refugee as he does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in Albania.\nGiven the lack of credibility of his evidence, I also find that the claimant is not a person in need of protection in that his removal to Albania would not subject him personally to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, and in that there are no substantial grounds to believe that his removal to Albania will subject him personally to a danger of torture. I therefore reject his claim.\n\"Eunice Harker\"\nEunice Harker\nDated in Ottawa this 21st day of January, 2003.\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - POLITICAL OPINION - DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE - PERSONAL INFORMATION FORM - CREDIBILITY - MALE - NEGATIVE - ALBANIA\n1 Exhibit C-2, Tab 1\n2 Exhibit C-2, Tab 6\n3 Exhibit C-2, Tab 5\n4Report on Albania submitted by the Canadian Embassy in Rome, July 2002\n5Exhibit C-2, Tab 1\n6Exhibit C-2, Tab 9\n7 Exhibit C-2, Tab 8\n8 Exhibit C-2, Tab 4\n9 Exhibit R-1, Tab 1 and Tab 5\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nFile AA1-01201\n12\n",

The claimant, a 31-year-old single female, claims a well-founded fear of persecution based on the grounds of religion, political opinion and membership in a particular social group. The claimant also claims to be a person in need of protection, as she believes she faces a danger of torture, cruel and unusual treatment or punishment and a risk of losing her life.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant fears the state authorities in Turkey as she is a devout follower of Fethullah G\u00fclen (a.k.a. Hizmet) and as a devout Muslim she is committed to keeping her head covered in public. Her claim arises out of the treatment she has received and the limits that the Turkish state has imposed on those women who elect to wear a headscarf.\nThe claimant asserts that prior to attending university in 1998 she had already begun to be a follower of the teachings of Fethullah G\u00fclen and others that his teachings are founded on. She had been raised as Muslim but her family was not devout. The claimant had already decided that an integral part of her devotion to her religion was to wear a headscarf at all times in public. The claimant took her University entrance exams in Istanbul in 1998 wearing her headscarf but when she went to get her student identity card she was told that she would have to remove her scarf. She agreed to do this after consulting a spiritual senior at the Fethullah G\u00fclen residence known as a \"lighthouse\", who told her that as it was only a photograph and not actually her being immodest in person, that it would be acceptable to agree.\nHowever when it came time to attend classes the claimant and many other young women wearing headscarves were prevented. A significant standoff resulted with police and anti-terrorist police at the gate preventing the women from entering the University. These demonstrations continued for more than a month until police prevented them from gathering there any more. Several women who had protested were arrested at their homes at this time.\nOn October 11, 1998 there was a country-wide protest on the issue of headscarves and some journalists and university faculty were arrested. Because of not being allowed to attend university the claimant continued to study at the Hizmet lighthouse but eventually a number of young women decided to go abroad for their university education.\nThe claimant's father agreed that she should go and she spent from XXXXX 1999 until XXXXX 2000 in the USA learning English and taking preparatory courses. She applied and was accepted at Carleton University, as it was cheaper than in a USA university. She studied in Canada until XXXX 2001 when she returned home for vacation.\nWhile she was in Turkey she was attending a summer camp of Hizmet and she asserts that three police officers interrupted their studies and took the claimant in for questioning about the activities at the lighthouse. She alleges she was insulted during this questioning but she was not physically mistreated and she was allowed to go home without any conditions.\nRealizing that she would continue to face problems in Turkey, she decided to leave the country for good when she returned to Canada to resume her studies in XXXXX 2001. She asserts that the continuing prohibition against wearing a headscarf at the University is depriving her of an education and that the prohibitions on wearing headscarves in schools and other government institutions effectively prohibits her from being able to have a significant number of jobs. She asserts that the ban also prevents her from practicing her religion, as the wearing of the headscarf is a fundamental requirement for her to be in compliance with her interpretation of the Koran.\nANALYSIS\nThe panel found the claimant to be an articulate witness who was persuasive on the issues of her devotion to her religion and the offensiveness to her of the Turkish state's attitude on the headscarf issue. She provided credible identity documents to establish her personal and citizenship identity.\nThe panel recognizes that she gave evidence in her oral testimony regarding the brief detention when she had returned to Turkey in 2001, which she had not included in her written narrative. The panel was satisfied with the claimant's explanation and found that it did not undermine her credibility in any significant way. Therefore the panel indicated to counsel that the only outstanding issue was that of discrimination versus persecution and asked for submissions only on that issue as it related to the headscarf issue and that of the treatment of the followers of Fethullah G\u00fclen.\nDiscrimination versus Persecution as a Fethullah G\u00fclen Follower\nThe claimant was never physically mistreated by the authorities although she describes being insulted on many occasions. She was prevented from attending university because she refused to remove her headscarf. However she was never prevented from attending mosque or practicing the tenets of her religion in any other way. She was free to live in a Hizmet lighthouse and she was free to study Fethullah G\u00fclen's teachings and philosophy.\nThe interest in the Fethullah G\u00fclen's lighthouses by the authorities results in occasional raids and some individuals being questioned about activities. This panel has examined all of the documentary evidence in the standard disclosure package on the issue of the treatment of Fethullah G\u00fclen followers in Turkey and cannot find sufficient evidence of the kind of serious, persistent, on-going harassment of Fethullah G\u00fclen followers or institutions that could amount to persecution.\nThe Turkish military, which exerts a considerable influence in the country, does view this movement with suspicion. It is viewed as fundamentalist and the Turkish state is extremely determined and concerned that nothing threatens the secular nature of the state. It opposes the notion of an Islamic state of any kind being established in the country and watches carefully any organizations that it thinks might be promoting such an idea. The documentary evidence1 reveals that Fethullah G\u00fclen followers have been intimidated and harassed. A professor of political science,2 knowledgeable on the Fethullah G\u00fclen movement, states that while followers may suffer harassment they do not face persecution and are permitted to carry out their activities in support of the movement.\nThe Turkish military's assessment of the potential danger posed by this movement certainly results in them treating followers in a different manner than other citizens. They discriminate based on their assessment of a potential political threat by a religious movement. However the \"lighthouses\" continue to exist and operate and the schools continue to teach his philosophy. The claimant did not experience persecution by being questioned for a few hours and not mistreated. Therefore in the evidence before this panel there is not evidence of such severe forms of harassment or discrimination such that it amounts to persecution, on either the ground of religion or imputed political opinion, for the claimant as a follower of Fethullah G\u00fclen.\nDiscrimination versus Persecution based on the wearing of a headscarf\nWhen the claimant was asked about the view of Fethullah G\u00fclen himself on the issue of the ban on headscarves, the claimant indicated that although he did not issue any specific directive his view was that it was an individual decision for every Muslim woman. She indicated that Fethullah G\u00fclen expressed his own view that if it came to a choice between a headscarf and an education, that education ought to be preferred. The claimant also indicated that there were female followers of Hizmet who did not cover their heads and that many removed their coverings when the ban came into force. There were no problems for those women continuing to live in the lighthouse and continuing to study the teachings of their leader. The panel therefore finds that it is not a requirement of being a follower of Fethullah G\u00fclen that a woman must wear a headscarf at all times in public.\nThe claimant is making a personal religious choice to continue to wear a headscarf. She regards it as a personal issue between herself and her God. The question this panel must resolve is, is what she is prevented from doing because she wears her headscarf so fundamental to her human dignity that the denial is persecution? Another panel has decided this issue in\nTA0-20552\/3\/4\/5\/6. The panel in these cases determined that the ban on headscarves in Turkish universities and other public institutions was discrimination and not persecution. While this decision is not binding on any other IRB panel, this panel finds it instructive in its assessment of all the religious freedom that exists in Turkey. Since this IRB decision, the European Court of Human Rights has made a decision on 13 February 2003. In its decision the ECHR states:\n\"1. In applying the above principles to Turkey the Convention institutions have expressed the view that the principle of secularism is certainly one of the fundamental principles of the State which are in harmony with the rule of law and respect for human rights and democracy. An attitude which fails to respect that principle will not necessarily be accepted as being covered by the freedom to manifest one's religion and will not enjoy the protection of Article 9 of the Convention (see the opinion of the Commission in the case of Kala\u00e7 v. Turkey, expressed in its report of 27 February 1996, Reports 1997-IV, p. 1215, \u00a7 44, and, mutatis mutandis, Kala\u00e7 v. Turkey, cited above, p. 1209, \u00a7\u00a7 27-31).\n2. In order to perform its role as the neutral and impartial organiser of the exercise of religious beliefs, the State may decide to impose on its serving or future civil servants, who will be required to wield a portion of its sovereign power, the duty to refrain from taking part in the Islamic fundamentalist movement, whose goal and plan of action is to bring about the pre-eminence of religious rules (see, mutatis mutandis, Yanasik v. Turkey, no. 14524\/89, Commission decision of 6 January 1993, DR 74, p. 14, and Kala\u00e7 v. Turkey, cited above, \u00a7 28).\n3. In a country like Turkey, where the great majority of the population belong to a particular religion, measures taken in universities to prevent certain fundamentalist religious movements from exerting pressure on students who do not practise that religion or on those who belong to another religion may be justified under Article 9 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. In that context, secular universities may regulate manifestation of the rites and symbols of the said religion by imposing restrictions as to the place and manner of such manifestation with the aim of ensuring peaceful co-existence between students of various faiths and thus protecting public order and the beliefs of others (see, Karaduman v. Turkey, no. 16278\/90, Commission decision of 3 May 1993, DR 74, p. 93).\"\nThe panel notes that the ECHR is not addressing the specific issue that is before this panel, but the decision is of interest in regard to its findings on the rights of the state and of the secular universities.\nThere are two more recent decisions from the ECHR3 where the Court has found that a ban on headscarves is not an infringement of the freedom of religion within the meaning of S.9 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\nThe claimant in the present case suffered no other harm than being questioned, insulted, and being denied attendance at a secular state university. The ECHR has upheld the right of the state or state institutions to limit certain rights in the interest of public order, and protecting the fundamental principles of the state. This is a well-established principle in Canada also. The state can discriminate against an individual, a minority or the majority in the interests of public order and protecting its fundamental principles. A state has an obligation to balance interests of individuals, minorities and the majority and the result can be some form of discrimination. The question to be resolved is, is the effect of the discrimination such that it amounts to persecution, either cumulatively or on the basis of the level of right that is being infringed upon.\nThe ban on headscarves can and has been the subject of challenges in the court system in Turkey all the way to the ECHR.\nThe panel finds that the claimant has not been denied her right to practice her religion freely. The panel further finds that claimant has failed to establish that the wearing of her headscarf is so fundamental a part of her religious observance as a devotee of Fethullah G\u00fclen, or as a Muslim, that to be denied the right to wear it constitutes religious persecution.\nThe issue that the panel must address in this case is whether the restriction on the claimant's right to wear a headscarf \"threatens his or her basic human rights in a fundamental way\" (Chan v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1995] 3 S.C.R. 593, at 635).\nThe claimant asserts that the interests that are harmed are her ability to attend a secular university or be employed as a government employee or a teacher in a state school. The panel must determine whether university education or the right to work as a government employee are basic human rights.\nThere seems to be no Canadian jurisprudence on the issue of whether university education is a basic human right. There is case law that held that education is a basic human right but in the context of children. In the Turkish context all state education up to University is provided free of charge. Education is compulsory for 8 years from age 6 to 14. Based on this evidence the panel finds that university education is not \"basic education\".\nIn his book, \"The Law of Refugee Status\" Professor Hathaway has identified four levels of rights within the hierarchy of rights and freedoms enumerated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) (pp. 108-112). The first level of rights includes the right from arbitrary deprivation of life, protection against torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment or treatment, freedom from slavery, and freedom of thought, conscience, and religion. Those rights are not derogable. The second level of rights includes freedom from arrest and arbitrary detention, right to equal protection for all, right to a fair and public hearing etc. Those rights are derogable in time of national emergency. The third level of rights include right to work, entitlement to food, clothing, housing, medical care, and basic education. Those rights are not absolute, the state is only required to \"take steps to the maximum of their available resources to progressively realize [these rights] in a non-discriminatory way\".\nWhile the panel finds the restrictions on women's attire to be the kind of infringement that women should not have to experience, the issue is the harm that the restriction causes. The claimant has benefited from free education up until the level of university. The harm of being denied a secular University education or having to travel abroad to get a university education is no doubt discriminatory but the panel finds it not to amount to persecution as it is not a denial of a fundamental first or second level right and is in fact not a denial of a third level right of a \"basic education\".\nThe panel is not of the view that the ban is part of a law of general application and is mindful of the Federal Court decision in Fathi-Rad v. S.S.C (F.C.T.D., no. IMM-2438-93), McGillis, April 13, 1994, in which the Trial Division found that a law which specifically targets the manner in which women dress may not be properly characterized as a law of general application. The panel does find the Turkish prohibition on the wearing of headscarves in government offices and state run institutions to be discriminatory. The panel however does not find that to be denied specific employment in government and state run institutions is a denial of a fundamental human right and therefore finds that such discrimination does not amount to persecution.\nThe claimant would not be denied an ability to earn a livelihood and she could teach in religious schools if she so chose. She failed to demonstrate that her ability to earn a livelihood would be so restricted that it would amount to persecution.\nFurther the claimant is free to advocate in a number of ways through the political process or through the court system for changes to the laws of Turkey. The wife of the President of Turkey wears a headscarf and it is causing political and diplomatic issues in Turkey. She declined to attend a gathering recently because of threats by other politicians to boycott it if she were there. It is a divisive issue in Turkey and is an issue that is causing frictions between different arms of the highest level of the government. The government does not restrict the claimant's right to peacefully protest the ban and to voice her opinions on the issue and to advocate for change.\nIn all of this the panel cannot find evidence of discrimination such that it amounts to persecution as the harm resulting from the discrimination is not the denial of basic fundamental or even third level human rights.\nIn all of the evidence and submissions before this panel, there is nothing of a sufficiently persuasive nature to establish on a balance of probabilities that if the claimant were to return to Turkey she would face treatment amounting to persecution either on the ground of religion, imputed political opinion or membership in a particular social group.\nDETERMINATION\nGiven all of the above the panel finds that XXXXXXXXXX is not a Convention refugee. Also as a result of the findings above the panel finds that there is insufficient evidence to establish that the claimant is a person in need of protection, in that there are no substantial reasons to believe that the claimant were she to be returned to Turkey would personally face a danger of torture, or a risk to her life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nI therefore reject her claim.\n\"Eunice Harker\"\nEunice Harker\nDated at Ottawa this 27th day of May 2003.\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - WOMEN RFUGEES - GENDER - RELIGION - POLITICAL OPINION - PARTICULAR SOCIAL GROUP - GENDER-RELATED PERSECUTION - PERSECUTION - DISCRIMINATION - INTERNATIONAL LAW - FEMALE - NEGATIVE - TURKEY\n1 Exhibit R-3 Binder E Tab 5.5 p. 3\n2 Exhibit R-3 Binder E Tab 5.2 p. 2 and 4\n3 Karduman and Bulut are the two decisions but the full citation was not available.\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRPD File # \/ No. dossier SPR : ___________\n1\nRPD File # \/ No. dossier SPR : AA1-01391\n9\n",

He was born in Rome and resided in Rome. His former wife and son, as well as mother, father, various sisters and brother reside in Italy.\nThe claimant came to Canada and his claim was referred on the 16th of November 2001. The claimant had initially not appeared for a conference into his claim and abandonment proceedings were commenced. The Show Cause hearing took place on 25 November 2003.\nI presided and I set aside abandonment proceedings and the claimant agreed to proceed with this hearing forthwith.\nThe claimant's evidence provided in his Personal Information Form (PIF), oral testimony and at the Port of Entry is that he is a person with strong moral values and ethical principles and is terribly frustrated about the corruption and dishonest behaviour he has experienced on the part of employers and other citizens in Italy.\nHe asserts that he cannot live in peace in Italy because he sees behaviour all around him that speaks corruption, from tax evasion to more egragious forms of dishonesty. This is very offensive to his character, he says, and he says politicians make little effort to get rid of corruption and such negative forces.\nThe matter weighs very heavily on him, he asserts, and he is concerned for the quality of life that he would have, as well as the quality of life his son would have, his son being XXX years old and currently living in Italy with the son's mother, the claimant's former wife.\nThe claimant spoke at length about his frustration with the problems of corruption in Italy. He indicated that these problems are well known, as are the political scandals Italy has experienced. He talked about difficulties finding a job and how people need to find jobs through the black-market and pay a finders' fee to get a job.\nThe claimant also made reference to confrontations he had in the workplace with supervisors. However, despite the fact that he was asked, he refused to provide any name of supervisor or company and he provided very few details with regard to the nature of the confrontation, other than that it had to do with conditions of work. However, his deep frustration with the situation in Italy led him to come to Canada and seek asylum.\nThe claimant also testified that in 1998, in a desperate situation, he attempted to take his own life. Happily, his brother found him, was able to take him to a hospital and the claimant said subsequently he met with a psychologist who told him or helped him understand the essence of his problems, but also told him that he was not insane. He shouldn't think of himself as such. He didn't require medications.\nThe claimant asserts that his moral and ethical standards are those of Canadians. His social values are those of Canadians and he expressed a deep love and admiration for Canada, the civility of its population and the quality of life here.\nThe claimant testified that he had been working in a very positive and comfortable environment in Canada for the last two years and, of course, this stands in contrast to the circumstances he described in his testimony, as well as in his PIF and at the Port of Entry, where,\nfor example, a construction site boss would ask him and other employees to leave the scene when inspectors would come and return only an hour later after the inspection. At the Port of Entry, the claimant makes reference to seeing his boss pay a bribe to an official and how, when he commented about this, he was given a reprimand.\nThose, essentially, are the claimant's assertions.\nANALYSIS\nThe claimant is a citizen of Italy and this is firmly established by his passport. Thus, his identity is established.\nIn the course of his evidence, the claimant asserted difficulties in finding work in Italy and the necessity of paying bribes. At the same time, it was pointed out to him during the course of the hearing that he held a succession of jobs between 1987 and '89, 1990 and '92, 1993 and 1995, 1996 and 1997 and 1999 in Italy, all in Rome at.\nThe claimant's own evidence with regard to his work history suggests to me that while he may have moved around from job to job, he was able to find work and able to keep himself gainfully employed over a period of more than a decade. This suggests to me, at least in the context of the evidence that he has provided, that should he return to Italy, he would have no problem finding work.\nWhen questioned about workplace conditions, the claimant was asked whether he had ever reported the illegalities he perceived to the police or to the unions and he said no. The claimant did not identify, when asked, what he feared should he return to Italy. He said that he wasn't sure how he would start over but said that he does not really know what would happen to him if he went back. At the same time, the thought of going back was very painful to him because his dream is to be in Canada.\nThe claimant said on at least two occasions that he did not know what would happen if he went back. The claimant was unable to provide any evidence to me suggesting that he had been faced with threat or harm amounting to persecution in the past or faced with cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or torture.\nThe determination process is forward-looking and in that context, I refer to the documentary evidence before me. The documentary evidence, which the claimant indicated that he had reviewed, indicates that Italy is a long-standing multiparty parliamentary democracy and that the rule of law obtains in Italy.\nThe documentary evidence indicates that Italy has a functioning judiciary and ample layers of protection for people seeking protection. The government respects freedom of speech and freedom of the press. The government respects the freedom of peaceful assembly and association. The government has enacted laws and acts on laws and respects laws prohibiting arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home or correspondence.\nSimply put, the evidence tells us that Italy is a democratic country, that protection exists and that the country is capable of protecting its citizens. The claimant was not able to provide any evidence to me of a failure of state protection. Indeed, his evidence is that he didn't even attempt to access protection for concerns that he had.\nThe documentary evidence does confirm that there is a problem with corruption in Italy and at the same time suggests that action is taken to fight corruption. At Tab 6 of Exhibit R-1, we read, with regard to the last decade, since anti-corruption trials began, eight former prime ministers and some 5,000 businessmen and politicians have been charged. There have been many investigations. At the same time, although the documentary evidence suggests the evidence was there to allow the conviction of many such people charged, a decade later, most of them have concluded their jail terms.\nThis evidence of corruption notwithstanding, it is not sufficient to raise doubt regarding Italy's ability to protect its citizens and it is not sufficient to suggest a breakdown in state machinery such as it would make protection impossible.\nThe claimant has failed to identify what he fears if he were to return to Italy. He has failed to be specific with regard to any of his past experiences. He has failed to satisfy me that there is any evidence of past persecution, torture or cruel and unusual treatment and punishment. In view of the documentary evidence, I find that the claimant's asserted fears are not justified to the extent that we can even identify what he fears.\nIn my view, the claimant has provided insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence for me to find that there exists more than a mere possibility of persecution on any Convention ground. Therefore, the claimant is not a Convention refugee.\nLikewise, the claimant has failed to provide sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence regarding anything he fears should he return to Italy to allow me to find in his favour under the provisions of Section 97 of the Immigration Act, whether having to do with torture or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\n.\nIn view of the totality of the evidence, for the reasons I have given, the claim made by XXXXXXXXXXX for Canada's protection is denied. I further find that there is no credible basis for this claim.\n\"Ian J. Kagedan\"\nIan J.

The claimant alleges that he is in need of Canada's protection because he is a Somali national and a member of the Reer Hamar, a minority clan.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant alleges that he was born in Mogadishu but moved to Hargeisa, in 1969 where he had his own XXXXXXX shop until 1988. Then when the civil war started he returned to Mogadishu but was forced to flee that city when war broke out in the South. In the course of his flight he became separated from his family who were able to make their way to Canada where they were successful in their claim for asylum. When the claimant heard that his family was here he came himself.\nANALYSIS\nThe claimant was advised that the issues in his claim are credibility and change of circumstances.\nCredibility\nWith regard to credibility, I begin with the observation that a lie is like the thirteenth chime of a clock, calling into question all that has gone before and everything that comes after.\nThere is no question in my mind that this claimant has lied about his travel to Canada. He said that he travelled with a false Namibian passport, which he could not describe because he\nnever had it in his possession. He knew nothing about this passport, neither its colour nor its contents. His explanation was that the smuggler he paid to bring him to Canada carried all the documents.\nThis is not a reasonable explanation. What would the claimant, a 51-year-old man, have done if some immigration or airline official had asked him questions about the Namibian passport? At the very least, it is reasonable to expect that the smuggler would have briefed him as to what the Namibian passport said just in case he was taken aside and questioned.\nThe claimant would have me believe that he boarded a plane in Addis Ababa, he disembarked at JFK in New York and he crossed the border into Canada at Fort Erie and at no time was he prepared to answer any questions about his false documentation. And not only that but at no time was he personally asked any questions.\nI don't believe him. Even had he travelled before September 11, 2001, I would not believe him. But he travelled after 9\/11 when security at border crossings in North America was at its height. In those circumstances the claimant's story, that he, a member of a visible minority, was not at any time asked any questions, is totally implausible.\nAnd here I note that the claimant has no airline ticket stubs to corroborate that he flew from Ethiopia to the United States at the time he alleges he did. I have presided at many hearings when such stubs are presented to substantiate a travel story and they are very helpful.\nBut more seriously than this absence of any ticket stubs is the fact that this claimant has nothing, he has no paper, no documentation whatsoever to buttress his story, nothing from Somalia and nothing from Ethiopia where he lived and worked for eight years before coming to Canada.\nSection 106 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) reads:\n\"The Refugee Protection Division must take into account, with respect to the credibility of the claimant, whether the claimant possesses acceptable documentation establishing identity, and if not, whether they have provided a reasonable explanation for the lack of documentation or have taken reasonable steps to obtain the documentation.\"\nThis section imposes a duty on the claimant to provide acceptable documents establishing his identity. It also incorporates a mandatory requirement for the panel to consider a claimant's lack of documents to establish identity in assessing a claim for refugee protection.\nSubsection 100(4) of IRPA provides, in part, that \"the claimant must produce all documents and information as required by the rules of the Board\". Section 7 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules reads:\n\"The claimant must provide acceptable documents establishing identity and other elements of the claim. A claimant who does not provide acceptable documents must explain why they were not provided and what steps were taken to obtain them.\"\nThe UNHCR Handbook, while recognizing the difficulty that claimants often have in being able to provide documentation to establish their claim, places nonetheless responsibility on claimants to provide evidence to support their claims and to attempt to obtain additional evidence if required (paragraphs 196 and 205).\nA lack of acceptable documents without a reasonable explanation for their absence, or the failure to take reasonable steps to obtain them, is a significant factor in assessing the credibility of a claimant.\nThe claimant's evidence with regard to Somali identity documents is that he lost them when he was in an accident travelling from Somalia to Dhagahbur, Ethiopia. However, the panel\nfinds it reasonable to expect that the claimant would have something from his eight years in Ethiopia particularly in view of the fact that for some of this time he worked \"as a broker in a wholesale warehouse\".\nThe claimant has not shown that he worked in a sophisticated and futuristic environment where no paper records of anything are kept at any time. He has offered no explanation as to why he has nothing to document his work time in Ethiopia, no receipts, no correspondence either of a business or personal nature. It is reasonable to expect, that if his story were true, he would have some paper to corroborate his eight years in Ethiopia.\nClearly identity is an important issue in any asylum claim. Indeed I would venture to say it is the most important issue, the sine qua non if you will. A decision maker has to be satisfied that a claimant is who he says he is. And it is the claimant's fundamental obligation to establish his identity on a balance of probabilities, the same way that he must establish all other elements of his claim.\nI note that the fact that this claimant speaks Somali is not all that helpful. There are substantial Somali-speaking communities in neighbouring countries including Ethiopia, communities populated by ethnic Somalis who have never set foot in Somalia.\nIn the absence of documents going to identity, the claimant has presented other evidence in an attempt to establish his identity.\nHis wife testified at the second sitting of the hearing as an identity witness. Essentially she confirmed that the claimant is who he says he is and lived where he said he did when he said he did. The weight that panels can give to identity witnesses in general is problematic because such testimony is neither objective nor disinterested and this is even more the case when such testimony comes from one's wife. So in the end I can give little weight to the testimony given by the claimant's wife.\nI received affidavits from two other possible identity witnesses but one of these did not present himself at either sitting to be questioned. I can therefore give very little weight to an affidavit without having the opportunity to question the author. The one identity witness who did make himself available for questioning was XXXXXXXXX, who alleged he was a friend of the claimant. His evidence is contained in Exhibit C3.\nAs I have already noted the weight a decision maker can give to identity witnesses is limited because their evidence is not objective or disinterested evidence. It is evidence that is open to abuse and, in my experience, it often is. However there are times when such evidence is helpful. This is not one of those times.\nAside from questions that could easily be anticipated and therefore answers rehearsed, there was very little, if anything, in the testimony of the claimant and the witness that was of any help to me to resolve my concerns with regard to the claimant's identity. For example, the witness, Mr. XXXXX, said that he met the claimant in Hargeisa in 1978. \"I would travel to Hargeisa several times a year to conduct my livestock trading business.\"\nWhen the claimant was asked about this, whether for example Mr. XXXXXX was buying or selling sheep, he said he didn't know. If the two knew each other as well as the witness said they did, it is not plausible that the claimant wouldn't know.\nFurthermore, the claimant was unsure of when it was that the two met. He didn't know if it was 1979 or 1978 or 1987.\nAlso there was disagreement as to when the first meeting took place. Was it after or before the claimant was married? The two gave contradictory answers.\nFinally after several minutes of this kind of testimony, and after observing the demeanour of the two when they interacted (it was a demeanour of two men who sat apart and barely looked at each other), I put it to the witness that he was not all that familiar with the claimant and he agreed. It is clear to me that what little familiarity exists between the witness and the claimant is a familiarity most probably bred here in Canada. It was most certainly not bred in Somalia.\nWanting to give the claimant every opportunity to establish his identity I then did what I often do in such circumstances and posed some questions about his knowledge of Mogadishu. I would reasonably expect he should have been able to easily answer these questions if he had ever lived in Mogadishu as he alleges he did. He is an intelligent man and quite well educated by Somali standards. I based my questions on my specialized knowledge and my reading of Somali history at the time of the lead-up to the civil war.\nFirst I asked about the layout of the city. The claimant's responses were far too sketchy to establish that he had lived in Mogadishu. There was not the spontaneity nor was there the degree of specificity one would reasonably expect from a resident.\nWith regard to what was going on in the city during the months leading up to the civil war I gave the claimant, who would have been in his late thirties at the time, several opportunities to tell me anything he could about a number of specific and violent incidents involving certain groups of people that occurred at this time. He was unable to do so. All he could say was that there were \"organizations\" fighting against the government. There \"was a lot of fear. People were being rounded up and accused of being anti-government.\"\nThis vague and general testimony is not what one would reasonably expect from such a man if he were indeed in Mogadishu as he said he was at this time.\nTherefore, in summary regarding the issue of credibility, I find that the claimant has not discharged the burden of proving on a balance of probabilities that he is a Somali national who lived in Somalia when he alleges he did.\nThe Federal Court has clearly stated in Husein v. Canada (M.C.I.), [1998] F.C.J. No 726 and Bhuiyan, Abdul Bashar v. M.C.I. (FCTD, no. IMM-53-02), No\u00ebl, March 10, 2003, that once the panel has concluded that identity has not been established by the claimant, it is not necessary to analyse the evidence any further.\nChange of circumstances\nBut if I am mistaken in this finding I will also examine the issue of change of circumstances with regard to the northwest portion of Somalia, i.e. Somaliland where the claimant alleges he lived for almost 20 years before war broke out. I have consistently found in similar cases that there has been a significant change of circumstances of long duration in Somaliland.\nI know this from my specialized knowledge and a thorough familiarity with the documentary evidence, that in contrast to the troubled central and southern regions, Somaliland is stable and peaceful, it has a national anthem, a flag, an army, a police force, its own judiciary, a legislative assembly and its own currency.\nGiven what I know of the area I asked the claimant why he could not return to that part of his former country known as Somaliland. His answer was two-fold, one that he would be killed because he is Reer Hamar and two that there is no government in Somaliland.\nThere is no documentary evidence to support the claimant's allegation that there is a reasonable chance that he would be killed because of his clan. In fact as the Refugee Protection Officer (RPO) pointed out in her observations, Exhibit R1 at Tab 29 says that there is no risk to Reer Hamar who have no background in politics or political activities. This claimant has not shown any such background.\nI find it interesting that the claimant who alleges he is a Somali national and once a long-time resident of the northwest would be so out of touch with recent Somali history that he would say there is no government in Somaliland. Quite plainly there is and there has been one for close to ten years now. And not only is there a government in place it is a government that welcomes people returning, people being repatriated by the UNHCR.1 There is no indication that the government of Somaliland is making distinctions with regard to the clans to which these returnees belong. I note that both counsel and the RPO made references to documentation that alleges some kind of distinctions being made along these lines but one has to be careful in citing and applying documentary evidence that pertains to the South as if the South were the same as Somaliland. It is not.\nI note that counsel in his submissions seems to be arguing that my decision should take into account humanitarian and compassionate concerns. He knows very well that such considerations are not the mandate of the Refugee Division.\nFurthermore counsel in his submissions also seemed to be raising the issue of compelling reasons but here I would simply point out that on the basis of my finding that the claimant is not who he says he is, I cannot therefore find that the claimant was persecuted for being a Somali, as he did not establish that he is a Somali, even less that he suffered appalling persecution on that basis.\nDETERMINATION\nIn the final analysis, I find that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is not in need of Canada's protection either as a Convention refugee or as a person in need of Canada's protection in accordance with sections 96 and 97 of IRPA. First and foremost, I believe he has lied to me in a manner that leads me to doubt the reliability of anything that he has said. He has not established on a balance of probabilities that he is a Somali national who lived in Somalia when he said he did. And if I am mistaken in these findings, I believe there is a change of circumstances that is significant, substantive and of long duration, that Somaliland has been safe since 1994, if not before, and that because he had once established himself there and worked there as a XXXXXX, the claimant could return. He should at the very least have explored the possibility before seeking Canada's protection. Canada should be the country of last resort - not the country of first resort.\nBased on the foregoing, I therefore reject the claim for refugee protection.\n\"Gary F. McCauley\"\nGary F.

He was born in Congo (Zaire) in 1955. He arrived in Sweden in 1986 as an asylum seeker, became a permanent resident there in 1987 and became a citizen of Sweden in 1990. He remained there with his then-wife XXXXXXXXX, a Zaire-born son and three other children born to him and his then-wife in Sweden. He had an older brother and cousin in Sweden as well. He and his then-wife divorced in 1994. He currently lives in Ottawa in a common law relationship with a Canadian citizen with whom he has one child. He claims Convention refugee status and asserts that he has a well-founded fear of persecution in Sweden on the grounds of his race. As well, he claims to be a person in need of protection because he would be subjected personally to a danger of torture and to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Sweden.\nThe Claimant's Evidence\nThe claimant's evidence was presented in his Personal Information Form (PIF), including a 13 1\/2 page narrative, and in over four hours of testimony.\nHe asserts that when he arrived in Sweden in 1986 as an asylum seeker, he was housed in a camp near XXXXX, where he was the only Black, and felt himself to be the only Christian. The camp was populated by Muslim asylum seekers, he asserts, and he was harassed for practicing his Christian religion. One Sunday, while going to the local church, he was beaten by a group of n\u00e9o-nazis and lost a tooth. He reported the incident to a camp official who was to pass his complaint on to the police. No one came to follow up. He relocated to another residence where, one evening, he was accosted by a Muslim called XXXX who tried to convince him to convert to Islam. He challenged and rejected the proposal and this angered XXXX, who threatened him using Arabic words that an Arabic-speaking friend related to him. He then moved to Hasselhom. It was 1987 and he had become a permanent resident, so he could study and work.\nIn Hasselhom, the claimant asserted, he met an Arab, XXXXXXXX, whom he challenged when the latter made anti-Jewish comments. The Arab threatened him with a knife and called him a \"dirty nigger\". A friend told him that XXXX had taken offence to his challenge and had threatened \"d'avoir ma peau\". He told his Swedish social worker (assistante social) about this and the matter was brought to the attention of the police, but they didn't follow up. XXXX XXXX later returned and threatened the claimant with a revolver, and told him to keep quiet or he would shoot his brains out. XXX had some prominence, he said, and had a radio program and edited a newspaper. He reported the incident to the police, who prepared a report but the matter stopped there, according to the claimant. He was also the victim of n\u00e9o-nazi harassment in the workplace in Hasselhom when someone had written \"Sweden for the Swedes\", and his v\u00e9lo was vandalized. A police officer who saw him walking it home took a report and told him to be careful. During the same time he became involved in Amnesty International through XXXX, one of his Swedish teachers, and had occasion to meet her husband who, in conversation, said that he shared XXXX XXXXX views. The claimant told XXXXX husband that XXXXX would be unhappy if she knew her husband was a friend of XXXXX. The husband took offence, told the claimant that Swedes didn't want him and that he was a \"Black slave of the Jews\". He related all this to XXXX.\nIn 1989, the claimant asserts, upon returning from a visit to Austria, he was the victim of a skinhead attack. A passing police officer told him to take a taxi and disappear. XXXXX husband came to visit him and mocked him, told him Swedes don't want Blacks and foreigners, and left a racist newspaper for him.\nThe claimant's evidence is that five years later, in 1994, he was living in Malmo. While travelling to Visby, even though a friendly Swede warned him not to stop in Sjobo, a racist community, he stopped there with his cousin at a service station. A gang of n\u00e9o-nazis attacked them, damaged their car, and told them not to come there again. A police officer took a report of the incident, and remarked about how the claimant always had problems with n\u00e9o-nazis.\nWhen the claimant complained that he was not protected, the officer asked, \"What do you want? To be assigned a body guard?\" and laughed when he said he should be protected because Sweden was a signatory to the Geneva Convention. This depressed the claimant so much that he needed hospitalization. He wanted to leave Sweden. Also in 1994 in Malmo he was attacked by skinheads. He wrote to the ombudsman to protest the lack of protection but got no reply.\nOnce out of the hospital, XXXXX called the claimant to say that she intercepted messages between her husband and his n\u00e9o-nazi friends and that it was urgent that the claimant leave Sweden. He was able to get a grant to study in Canada and arrived in Canada in 1995. He had divorced his wife in 1994 for reasons he declined to discuss, saying this was private.\nThe claimant studied in Canada from 1995 - 1998 and became involved in La Fondation XXXXX as a volunteer. When asked why he failed to seek asylum upon arriving in Canada, or at any point before his departure, he said that he planned to return to Sweden, thinking the situation would get better, but when he did return in 1998 he saw it was not better and, after a short while, left again. He then spent most of his time in France, Belgium and Denmark. When asked if he had made an effort, prior to returning to Sweden, to inform himself of the situation there through calling XXXXX or through the internet, he said he had seen reports about an organization set up to deal with integration, but he was not inclined to contact people from afar.\nThe claimant returned to Canada in XXXXX 2001, hoping to work for La Fondation XXXXXX, but this didn't work out. When asked why, given his conclusion, upon returning to Sweden, he didn't seek asylum upon returning to Canada, he said he knew that as a Swede he could stay six months. It was only after he was arrested and came to the attention of CIC, and was ordered removed and complied voluntarily with a removal order in the summer of 2002, that he returned to Canada and sought asylum.\nThe claimant testified that racist n\u00e9o-nazis were all over Sweden and were linked with each other. It would be impossible to live there. XXXXX husband, whom she divorced, blamed him for influencing his wife, he said and the now ex-husband has many contacts. He also feared harm at XXXXX hands. When he left Canada, briefly, in 2002, he had gone to Denmark where a friend of his, XXXXX, told him that racist skinheads had sworn to kill him.\nDetermination\nThe claimant does not face more than a mere possibility of persecution in Sweden. He is not a Convention refugee. As well, his removal to Sweden would not subject him personally to a danger of torture or to a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. He is not a person in need of Canada's protection.\nAnalysis\nHarassment and Discrimination Not Amounting to Persecution\nOver the course of the claimant's nine year residence in Sweden from 1986 to 1995 and again briefly in 1998, the claimant allegedly experienced four attacks by racist skinheads. Two attacks occurred in the period from 1986 to 1989 and two occurred in 1994, including one when, against the advice of a thoughtful person he met, he and his cousin stopped in a place known to have a n\u00e9o-nazi presence. He also was twice threatened and harassed by Muslims, including a well-known racist anti-Semite, XXXXXXXXXX.\nDuring the same nine years the claimant sought and received asylum in Sweden, became a Swedish citizen, had his then-wife and first-born child join him, and had three more children born in Sweden. He benefited from the Swedish social welfare system from which, he testified, he believes his former wife and children benefit now. He also was continually employed, was able to get further education and training, and was able to support his growing family all along. He provided no evidence to indicate that his then-wife and that his children had any particular problems on account of their race or relationship with him. As noted above, they continue to live in Sweden.\nThe evidence before me suggests that the claimant was able to have a productive and relatively harassment-free life in Sweden, except for the two skinhead encounters and harassment by racist Muslims in the initial three years of his Swedish residency, and the 1994 incidents, one of which was brought on by the claimant and his cousin's ignoring a warning from a friendly Swede. The claimant's experiences with racist violence at the hands of skinheads did not occur with repetition or persistence, not in a systematic way. They lack the \"element of repetition and relentlessness found at the heart of persecution\". (See Valentin v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) [1991] 3 F.C. 390 (C.A.), at 396). I thus find that what the claimant experienced in Sweden between 1986 and 1994 was discrimination and harassment, which, even taken cumulatively does not amount to persecution. Inasmuch as the claimant has not provided me with evidence to support the contention that the situation he would face in Sweden were he to return there would be worse than what he had faced in the past, I find that he does not face more than a mere possibility of persecution in Sweden on the grounds of his race or any other Convention grounds, even on a cumulative basis. Documentary evidence canvassed below in my analysis of state protection supports this conclusion. I find as well, based on the same evidence, that the claimant's removal to Sweden would not subject him personally to a danger of torture or to a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nState Protection\nThe claimant's claim fails, in the alternative, on account of the availability of state protection for him in Sweden. My analysis which follows includes an examination of the claimant's own evidence in the context of the documentary evidence before me on Sweden. In assessing the availability to the claimant of state protection, I will first examine country documentation going to the issue, then examine the claimant's own experiences with State authorities then assess that evidence against the standards established in Canadian jurisprudence.\nThe country documentation before me does indeed indicate that Sweden has a problem with racist skinhead and n\u00e9o-nazi activity, with the US Department of State Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 2001, issued in 2002, (commonly known as the \"DOS Report\") at Exhibit A1 tab 2, indicating that most reports placed the number of active n\u00e9o-nazis at fewer than 2,000 while the same Report on events in 2002, in Exhibit A2, issued in 2003, places the figures at fewer than 3,000. That same 2002 Report notes that in 2001 there were 2,670 xenophobic crimes and notes a modest increase in the number of incidents of documentation in the workforce. At the same time, the Report indicates that the public has urged a tougher stance against n\u00e9o-nazi groups, that demonstrators against violence and racism were held throughout the country, and that the government supported volunteer groups opposing racism and xenophobia and provided funding for projects supporting people who left such extremist racist organizations. Another 2002 report, by the International Helsinki Federation at Exhibit A tab 3, indicates that the government made the fight against racist crimes a high priority, but, according to this source, more effort was needed to educate police and judicial officials about racist organizations and racist crimes. Legislation exists, we read, since 1994, that allows courts to view the racial motivation in crimes as an aggravating circumstance. At the same time, the Helsinki Federation indicates that there was concern this law was not being adequately applied. Finally, evidence in Exhibit A3 from February 2003 indicates that:\nLes sources consult\u00e9es par la Direction des recherches mentionnent un seul cas d'un r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 d'origine africaine qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de violence en su\u00e8de, soit celui d'un homme qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 tu\u00e9 en 1995 par une groupe de skinheads (Antisemitism and Xenophobia Today d\u00e9c. 1996; Bjorgo 15 avr. 2002; Peterson 15 avr. 2002). Cependant, un article du 23 novembre 2000 signale que les [traduction] \"immigrants originaires de l'Afrique et des pays arabes sont particuli\u00e8rement susceptibles de faire l'objet de violence et de discrimination \" en Su\u00e8de (Deutsche Press-Agentur 23 nov. 2000).\nLa Su\u00e8de a modifi\u00e9 son code criminel en 1995 et a fait du racisme une circonstance aggravante lorsqu'un crime est perp\u00e9tr\u00e9 (Antisemitism and Xenophobia Today d\u00e9c. 1996). En 1996, pour le meurtre du r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 d'origine africaine mentionn\u00e9 ci-dessus, la Cour supr\u00eame de Su\u00e8de a [traduction ] \" concentr\u00e9 son attention sur le fait que la victim [...] \u00e9tait noire, et que l'auteur de l'acte, au moment de l'agression, avait des opinions racistes. Sur cette note, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 statu\u00e9 que le motif de l'acte \u00e9tait d'agresser la victime en raison de sa couleur ou de son origine \" (Bjorgo 15 avr. 2002).\nThe above makes clear that Sweden has a problem with racist skinhead and n\u00e9o-nazi activity, but recognizes the challenge it faces and had made dealing with the problem a high priority. This is confirmed in further documentary evidence. For example, the same DOS 2002 Report indicates:\nSweden is a constitutional monarchy and a multiparty parliamentary democracy. The King is Head of State. The Cabinet, headed by the Prime Minister, exercises executive authority. The judiciary is independent.\nThe Government maintains effective control of the police, all security organizations, and the armed forces. The police provide internal security and the military provide external security.\nThe country has an advanced industrial economy, mainly market based, with a total population of approximately 8.92 million. Citizens enjoy a high standard of living, with extensive social welfare services.\nThe Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law and judiciary provided effective means of dealing with individual instances of abuse.\n...\nA number of domestic and international human rights groups generally operated without government restrictions, investigating and publishing their findings. Government officials were very cooperative and responsive to their views. Several private organizations actively monitored issues such as the effect of social legislation, anti-immigrant or racist activities, and the condition of the indigenous Sami population. Government agencies were in close contact with a variety of local and international groups working in the country and abroad to improve human rights observance.\n...\nCourt decisions have held that it is illegal to wear xenophobic symbols or racist paraphernalia. Rightwing groups were not permitted to display signs and banner with provocative symbols at their rallies. A march in Salem on December 7 - the second anniversary of the murder of a skinhead in a Stockholm suburb - attracted approximately 1,200 rightwing extremists, the largest neo-Nazi march in the country since World\nWar II. Earlier on the same day, in the same neighbourhood anti-racist activists carried out a counterdemonstration.\n...\nThe Prime Minister announced establishment of an independent center to fight racism and intolerance.\n...\nThe official government ombudsmen may publicize abuses of state authority and initiate actions to rectify such abuses.\nTaken together with the report in Exhibit A3, the above leads me to find that Sweden recognizes the problems it has with racist skinheads and n\u00e9o-nazi activity, and takes meaningful and effective steps to combat such activity and contain it. The DOS Report plainly states that \"the law and judiciary provided effective means of dealing with individual instances of abuse\":\nIn Ward (Canada (Attorney General) v. Ward, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 689, 103 D.L.R. (4th) 1, 20 Imm. L.R. (2a) 85) the Supreme Court of Canada established it to be a fundamental presumption that except in situations where the State is in a state of complete breakdown, states are capable of protecting their citizens. This presumption can be rebutted by \"clear and convincing\" evidence of a State's inability to protect. In my view, the claimant has failed to provide \"clear and convincing\" evidence to rebut the presumption that Sweden can protect him.\nThe claimant's own evidence going to the issue of state protection is that on the various occasions he was either threatened or assaulted, either he or a refugee camp or social assistance worker filed reports with the police, but there was no follow-up. Beyond the lack of follow-up, the claimant also reported rude and insulting comments by some police officers. On one occasion, in the initial year of his residency in Sweden, a police officer told him to be careful, after meeting him walking his damaged velo home. The claimant said the officer initially\nsuspected he might have stolen the velo, and asked for his papers to establish ownership. This was readily established, at which time the advice to be careful was offered. In 1989, a police officer nearby told the claimant, after he was beaten by skinheads, to take a taxi and disappear. The claimant suggested the officer driving by failed to protect him from the sudden attack. Finally, the claimant testified that when police attended after he and his cousin were attacked in XXXXX in 1994, after taking down details for a report, the officer commented how the claimant always had problems with n\u00e9o-nazis. It was then that the claimant suggested that he was not protected, as he should be under the \"Geneva Convention\" and the officer laughed, asking the claimant whether the claimant thought he ought to be assigned a bodyguard.\nWhat we have above is a modest collection of incidents where the claimant believes the police response was inadequate. With regard to the alleged lack of follow-up by police, or the ombudsman, I note that there was, equally, a lack of follow-up by the claimant. He provided no evidence of pursuing matters further after making his initial reports. The same applies to what the claimant sees as rude or insulting comments made by police - the claimant provided no evidence of having registered complaints with the police hierarchy regarding the comments of such officers. Sweden is a longstanding, stable constitutional monarchy and multi-party parliamentary democracy. In Kadenko (Kadenko v. Canada Solicitor General) (1995), 32 Imm. L.R. (2a) (275) (F.C.T.D.) ) the Court held that \"the more democratic the State's institutions, the more the claimant must have done to exhaust all the courses of action open to him\" to get state protection. On appeal, the Federal Court of Appeal dealt with the following certified question:\nWhere there has not been a complete breakdown of the government apparatus and where a State has political and judicial institutions capable of protecting its citizens, does the refusal by certain police officers to take action suffice to establish that the State in question is unable or unwilling to protect its nationals?\nThe court answered the question in the negative:\nOnce it is assumed that the state (Israel in this case) has political and judicial institutions capable of protecting its citizens, it is clear that the refusal of certain police officers to take action cannot in itself make the state incapable of doing so. ...\nWhen the state in question is a democratic state ... the claimant must do more than simply show that he or she went to see some members of the police force and that his or her efforts were unsuccessful. The burden of proof that rests on the claimant is, in a way, directly proportional to the level of democracy in the state in question: the more democratic the state's institutions, the more the claimant must have done to exhaust all the courses of action open to him or her. (at 2-3) (M.C.I. v. Kadenko, Ninal (F.C.A., no. A-388-95), Hugessen, D\u00e9cary, Chevalier, October 15, 1996. Reported: Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Kadenko (1996), 143 D.L.R. (4th) 532 (F.C.A.), (application for leave to appeal dismissed by the S.C.C. on May 8, 1997). See also M.C.I. v. Smith, Bob (F.C.T.D., no. IMM-3068-97), Lutfy, December 7, 1998, where the Court stated that \"the quantum of clear and convincing evidence required to rebut the presumption of a state's ability to protect will depend on its democratic processes.\")\nThe claimant's evidence regarding his interactions with Swedish police, and, for that matter, the ombudsman, is clearly insufficient to rebut the presumption of state protection. The claimant did not exhaust all the courses of action open to him as a Swedish citizen. Finally, as sarcastic and rude as the officer may have been in asking the claimant whether he wanted a body guard, it appears to me to reflect what our courts have articulated: that the standard of protection a country needs to offer its citizens is \"adequate though not necessarily perfect\" (see Zalzali v. Canada ) Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1991] 3 F.C. 605 (C.A.), at 615).\nConclusion\nBased on the analysis provided above, I conclude that the claimant is not a Convention refugee and that he is not a person in need of protection and therefore reject his claim for refugee protection.\n\"Ian J.

The claimant had a child born on XXXXXX, 1992.\nThe claimant asserts that approximately three months after they began living together, the claimant's common-law spouse began his abusive behaviour. He would come home drunk. He would beat her. She alleges that he constantly forced her into having sex with him against her will and that on some occasions, he would hit their son, although she indicates that it was not a constant problem and he did not seriously hurt the child.\nThe claimant describes the most serious incident to have occurred at the end of August 1999 when she was severely beaten. The claimant alleges that she was kicked in the stomach, punched all over, that her face and head were punched, and that she had bruises and was swollen all over her body. She went to her mother's house and the mother helped her to treat her injuries.\nThe claimant believing that her husband would kill her if she went back to him, stayed with her mother and then left El Salvador on the XXXXX 1999. She went to Mexico where she lived until XXXX 2001. The claimant then went to the United States illegally, was apprehended by US Immigration and was under an order to be deported. The claimant came to Canada and made her refugee claim on November 13, 2001. The claimant did not make a refugee claim in Mexico or in the United States.\nThe claimant asserts that she did not seek police protection because she believed that the police did not pay a lot of attention to domestic violence situations, that her husband may be taken to court but likely given a light sentence, and that when he was released, he would harm her. The claimant asserts that her common-law husband threatened to kill her if she reported to the police.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\nThe panel finds the claimant established her personal and citizenship identity through credible documents.\nState protection\nThe claimant was without legal representation and at a conference and at the outset of the hearing, the claimant was advised that the central issue in the claim would be that of state protection and the questions asked during the hearing went to this issue.\nThe panel finds the claimant presented insufficient credible evidence to rebut the presumption of state protection in El Salvador. The panel, in assessing the evidence presented, has been guided by the gender guidelines and has been mindful of the psychological effects on women victims of spousal abuse.\nThe presumption of state protection exists where there is a democratic state in control of its territory with a functioning law enforcement system and an independent judiciary. The efforts that the claimant made to access state protection must be examined and determined if these steps were reasonable.\nThe claimant's evidence is that she did not seek the assistance of the police at any time throughout the course of the number of years of abuse. She never reported this abuse to anyone other than her family. She made no attempt to contact any organization that assists victims of domestic violence and she made no attempt to move to another part of the country to live with relatives or on her own before seeking international protection.\nThe documentary evidence in this case clearly establishes that domestic violence is a problem in El Salvador, as it is in many, many countries. There is a significant problem of under reporting and the range of reasons why women do not report domestic violence are the fears of reprisal, the feelings of isolation, shame and others. This claimant's explanation for not seeking any state protection is that she was afraid of her husband's reprisals and that she believed that the police wouldn't take her seriously and that if they did prosecute, her common-law husband would suffer a short jail term and be free to harm her again.\nThe documentary evidence indicates that there are two significant laws in El Salvador to protect victims of domestic violence. In Exhibits R-1 and R-2, these laws are explained and detailed. The Law Against Intra Family Violence was enacted in December 1996 and an amendment to the Penal Code came into force in April 1998. Both of these laws were in effect prior to the claimant leaving El Salvador.\nThe Law Against Intra Family Violence contains a number of provisions and amongst those people who are protected under this law are married couples, formerly married couples, live-in partners, individuals who have been live-in partners in the past, et cetera. The protections that this law offers are: the perpetrator can be ordered to refrain from engaging in intimidating or acts of violence; the perpetrator must refrain from threatening the victim in public or in private; protection measures can be ordered by a competent authority; and the perpetrator can immediately be forced to vacate the dwelling shared with the victim; the victim could be provided with an alternative place of residence; the perpetrator can be prohibited from possessing or bearing firearms; the victim can be granted exclusive custody of the dwelling for a prescribed period of time and the victim be provided with an order granting him or her police protection. The amendment to the Penal Code makes violence against women a criminal offence.\nIn Exhibit R-31 the Pan-American Health Organization in San Salvador reports that in 1997 there were two shelters for abused women in San Salvador, and that the most important part of the new Law in Prevention of Intra Family Violence is that it classifies violence or abuse as a punishable crime. This organization, which monitors women's issues in El Salvador reports that police do respond to domestic violence calls and do intervene. It further reports that there is an ongoing training program for police personnel to promote awareness and enable them to deal with domestic violence cases. Police can detain a violent spouse for a short period and the person will be kept in police custody longer if a legal process is opened. At the time of the report in 1997, the victim had to press charges in domestic violence cases.\nHowever, the 2001 Criminal Code reforms eliminate the provision allowing victim's pardon to nullify a criminal charge regarding rape, and spousal rape can be considered a crime if the action meets the Criminal Code's definition of rape. Further the Criminal Code provisions permit the Attorney General to prosecute in the case of rape with or without a complaint from the victim.\nAccording to Exhibit R-2,2 in El Salvador domestic violence increasingly is being recognized publicly and has become a topic for national debate. Government institutions such as the PDDH, the Attorney General's office, the Supreme Court, the Public Defender's office, and the PNC coordinated efforts with NGOs and other organizations to combat violence against women through education, government efforts to increase enforcement of the law and NGO support programs for victims.\nThere is a hotline, as well as a shelter for victims of domestic abuse operated through the National Secretariat for the Family and this ISDEMU, the Salvador Institute for the Development of Women, received 3,725 cases of domestic violence during the year, an increase of over 300 from the previous year.\nThe claimant also gave evidence that she was aware of an organization which she referred to as \"Be a woman\" and that she had known of the existence of this organization for many years and that she knew of it because there were advertisements on television showing women how to take action if they were victims of domestic violence. When asked, the claimant indicated that she had seen these advertisements on television daily. While the claimant was not specifically aware of the laws in place, she had some sense that there was state involvement, given that she had seen these advertisements on television regularly.\nWhen the claimant was asked why she never contacted any women's organizations for assistance in accessing state protection, the claimant's explanation was that she was afraid that it would be like going to the police. She thought that while they might be able to help her, it would be short term, and her husband would eventually be more determined to harm her if she had raised the issue with an organization or with the police.\nWhile the panel is sympathetic to the claimant's relative young age when this abuse started and the typical feeling of isolation and inability to take action, the panel finds that the claimant made no effort to access any protection in her own country, other than asking her mother to assist her. The claimant has family in the city of San Salvador where there are shelters for women and the panel finds the claimant's explanations for not accessing this available opportunity of contacting women's organizations, being able to go to a shelter, using the hotlines available provided by the state, or attempting to have her husband restrained from harming her in any way by the police, all to be insufficient attempts to access available state protection.\nThe documentary evidence clearly establishes that state protection is available and accessible. The laws are in place, they are publicized, they are being enforced and there is training for police officers. There are steps being taken to fund non-government organizations in order to assist women in accessing law enforcement and the judiciary and the claimant did not attempt to use any of these available resources.\nWhile the problem of domestic violence continues to be a problem, the documentary evidence clearly indicates that the government of El Salvador is taking pro-active measures to deal with the issue and the claimant failed to take any steps to access this protection.\nThe panel finds that state protection is available and is accessible and while it is not absolute, a state is not required to provide absolute protection at all times. Protection need not be perfect. It must be adequate and effective and accessible. The panel finds that the claimant in failing to take any steps to access any of the available protection has failed to provide evidence to rebut the presumption of state protection in El Salvador.\nDETERMINATION\nThe panel therefore finds that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is not a Convention refugee. Given the finding with regard to the adequacy of state protection in El Salvador, the panel further finds that the claimant is not a person in need of protection, in that if she were to be returned to El Salvador, she would not personally face a risk to her life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. There was no evidence adduced to assert that there would be a danger of torture at the hands of the state. I therefore reject her claim.\n\"Eunice Harker\"\nEunice Harker\nDated at Ottawa this 12th day of June 2003.\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - WOMEN REFUGEES - GENDER - PARTICULAR SOCIAL GROUP - DOMESTIC VIOLENCE - GENDER-RELATED PERSECUTION - STATE PROTECTION - FEMALE - NEGATIVE - EL SALVADOR\n1 Response to Information Request SLV-25693\n2 Tab 1, U.S. Department of State Report on Human Rights Practices in El Salvador for 2002.\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRPD File # \/ No. dossier SPR : ___________\n1\nRPD File # \/ No. dossier SPR : AA2-01089\n6\n",

Vous n'avez qu'\u00e0 en faire la demande par \u00e9crit \u00e0 l'adresse suivante : 344, rue Slater, 14e \u00e9tage, Ottawa (Ontario) K1A 0K1, par courriel \u00e0 traduction@cisr.gc.ca ou par t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur au (613) 947-3213.\nThese are the reasons for the decision in the claim for refugee protection of\nXXXXXXXXXXXXX, a citizen of Libya.\nThe claimant is a 27-year-old male who claims a well-founded fear of persecution in Libya based on his perceived political opinion. He further claims to be a person in need of protection in that his removal to Libya would subject him personally to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment and a risk to his life and to a danger of torture.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant provided a detailed account of his fear at the hands of the Libyan intelligence at Question 41 of his Personal Information Form (PIF)1.\nThe claimant was born in Tripoli, Libya. He states that he secretly opposed the repressive regime of Colonel Al-Qadhafi. He did not openly criticize the regime for fear of reprisals because the government does not tolerate political opposition in any form.\nThe government does, however, allow free access to the Internet and satellite television and both of these are accessed easily in Tripoli.\nThe claimant alleges that he began to \"surf the Internet\" in or about June 2001. He was interested in watching the news and various sites and in particular \"opposition websites\". These opposition websites openly criticized the government and promoted a more democratic form of government. Some of the websites he visited were www.libyanet.com, www.aklbarlibya.com and United Libya for Human Rights. The claimant admits that all of his website visits where he viewed sites which opposed the government were done either when he was alone, in the security\nof his own home, or at trusted friends' homes or trusted friends' offices. The claimant alleges that the website visits continued until just shortly before he left Libya in October 2002 when he came to Canada to study.\nThe claimant alleges that the Libyan government did not possess the necessary technology to block these unwanted sites and that the government depends on spies and informers in order to trap people who view these sites.\nIn March 1998, the claimant received his diploma from the XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX in Tripoli. He alleges that he received some military training for a period of about four months. When the claimant was asked what date the training started, he replied \"after graduation, but I don't remember, between 1998 and 1999\".\nThe claimant was then asked if he could be more precise and give at least the months he was in military training. He responded, \"I think I finished in the beginning of 1999, it is possible\". When the claimant was asked to give the date this training commenced, he stated, \"I don't remember exactly\". He states, however, that when he completed his training, he was given a card which certified he had completed the military training. According to him, it was necessary to have this card in order to find employment in Libya.\nThe claimant did not bring this card with him to Canada. He did not think he would need it.\nThe claimant did not work from January 1999 until late 1999, when he enrolled in another computer course at XXXXXX XXXXXX XXXXXX in Tripoli. When he was asked to give the date the course commenced, the claimant stated, \"I think I started at the end of 1999, maybe November or December 1999\". This was a six months course. He alleges he graduated from the course and received a certificate. Again, he admitted he did not bring the certificate to Canada or to the hearing because he did not think it was necessary.\nThe claimant asserts that after he completed the computer course at XXXXXX XXXXX XXXXXXX, either in May or June 2000, he joined the XXXX XXXXX XXXXXXX to study and become a computer supervisor. Again, when he was asked to give a date or month when this latest course started, the claimant replied - \"near the end of the year\".\nThe claimant asserts that he completed this course and that he was then qualified to be a computer supervisor.\nThe claimant produced at the hearing, as proof that he had completed the computer supervisor course, an undated document which is titled \"XXXXX XXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXX XXXXX\"2.\nThis document, which is allegedly signed by the Director of the institute, certifies that the claimant worked in the institute as a Technical Supervisor.\nThe claimant alleges that he received excellent grade marks when he studied at the XXXXXX XXXXXXX XXXXX and, because of his standing in the class, he received a scholarship, sponsored by the government of Libya, to study either in India or in Canada, all expenses paid.\nThe claimant's old passport had expired. He applied for and obtained a new passport in XXXXX 2001. The passport3 was issued to the claimant on XXXXX, 2001. The claimant then applied for and obtained an Indian visa4, which was issued to the claimant on XXX-2001.\nThe claimant applied for his Canadian visa in Tunis (he states one would not have been issued to him in Libya). This visa5 was issued to the claimant on XXXX-2001.\nThe claimant admitted that he applied in person to obtain his passport. He had no difficulty whatsoever in obtaining it.\nThere were valid reasons why the Refugee Protection Officer, Ms Lindsay, questioned the claimant extensively about his activities in Libya between March 1998 and January 1, 2002. At Question 17 of his PIF, the claimant was asked to list all schools and educational institutions he attended. The claimant listed four different schools or institutions between September 1983 up to and including March 1998.\nThe claimant's next listing of such institutions began in January 2002 and concluded in September 2002. There was no listing for any schools or institutions between March of 1998 and January 2002 (nearly four years).\nThe claimant had produced no documents other than his January 2001 passport to prove that he was physically present in Libya during that period of time. The claimant states, however, that he was in Libya for that whole period of time except for two visits. His first visit was to China as a tourist in XXXX 1998. His second visit was when he came to Canada in XXXX 2002 to study (on the government sponsored scholarship) between XXXX 2001 and XXXX 2002.\nThe claimant had come to Canada to study the English language and to obtain his XXXXXX XXXXXX XXXX. However, the Libyan government recalled the claimant when it discovered he had not been accepted for his Master's program because he lacked one year of undergraduate study.\nThe claimant alleges he returned to Libya in XXXXX 2002 as requested by his government.\nIn his PIF narrative, the claimant alleges he \"went back to Libya to see my family and get some money\". He wanted to return to Canada to complete his studies but now at his parents' expense.\nThe claimant alleges he left Libya on XXXXX, 2002 to return to Canada. He had absolutely no difficulties boarding the airplane in Tripoli or leaving the country. Up to this point in time, the claimant had no suspicions that Libyan Intelligence was interested in him for anything he had done while he lived in Libya.\nThe claimant's plane arrived in Toronto, Ontario on October 6, 2002. On the following day, namely October 7, the claimant alleges that he telephoned home to tell his parents he had arrived safely. The claimant alleges that his father then told him, \"Some people from the Libyan Intelligence came to our home and asked about me\". Somehow, the Intelligence people had found out the claimant had been \"surfing the Net\", that he had a relationship with some people via Internet who were in opposition to the government and, that he was working with the opposition and giving information about Libya.\nIt appeared obvious to me and to Ms Lindsay that the only way the Intelligence people would gain knowledge of his website surfing would have been through an informer or a spy. The only persons who knew about these searches was the claimant himself and the claimant's trusted best friends, who also had been doing their own similar website searches.\nWhen the claimant was asked by Ms Lindsay whom he thought might have been the informant, he replied, \"I don't know\". He was asked whether he thought one his trusted friends had informed on him. The claimant responded, \"Maybe\". The claimant stated that in secrecy, the whole of the Libyan population hates the government but that the country was full of spies and informers.\nThe claimant was asked the following questions by me about the incident concerning the security forces who allegedly came to his father's home and he responded accordingly:\nQ. What time of the day did they arrive?\nA. Around noon.\nQ. How many persons came to the house?\nA. It could have been three or more.\nQ. Were they male or female?\nA. They were probably males.\nQ. How were they dressed?\nA. I have no details.\nQ. How long did they stay?\nA. I don't know.\nQ. How did they arrive at the house?\nA. I don't know.\nQ. Did your father tell them that you were in Canada?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Would there be security forces at the airport?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Any difficulties leaving Libya on XXXXX?\nA. None. I left with normal activities and flew out of Tripoli.\nQ. Why did the security forces not get to you at the airport if they were really interested in you?\nA. I don't know why, maybe the report was late and it arrived to them late.\nQ. Did the Libyan government agree to pay all of your expenses (approximately $13,150 Canadian) to come to Canada?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Would the government not investigate your background to ensure that you were qualified to go to Canada (in a political sense) before it agreed to grant the scholarship?\nA. It is possible - they could.\nQ. Why then would they (the government) accuse you of \"being in opposition\"?\nA. Everything changed - the report may have come too late.\nThe claimant now alleges that if he returns to Libya, he will be detained by security forces immediately because he is connected to the opposition and because of his website searches. The claimant alleges further that if that were to happen, he would be subjected to hard punishment, put into prison where he would be tortured and even killed.\nThis concluded the claimant's testimony.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\nThe claimant's identity and his Libyan citizenship are established by his testimony and his Libyan passport presented to Citizenship and Immigration Canada. I accept that he is a citizen of Libya.\nDocumentary evidence\nA thorough review of the documentary evidence6 ; gives vivid details of the type of regime that controls the activities of the people in Libya and the restrictions on persons leaving and entering the country.\nLibya is controlled by the cold handed fist of Colonel Al-Qadhafi and his henchmen. He created a political system that rejects democracy and all political parties. The country maintains an intrinsic security system. The result is a multi-layered pervasive surveillance system that monitors and controls the activities of individuals.\nThe government infringes on citizens' privacy rights and citizens do not have the right to be secure in their homes or persons. Torture and other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment is commonplace.\nProfessionals and students have been arrested for alleged involvement with the Islamic organizations not known to have used or advocated violence.\nStudents studying abroad have been interrogated upon their return. One credible foreign observer estimated that 10 to 20 % of the population was engaged in surveillance for the government.\nThe government severely limits freedom of speech and of the press and expressly true with regard to criticism of Qadhafi or his government. Laws were enacted so vague that many forms of speech or expression may be interpreted as illegal and by using many informants, the government has created an atmosphere of mistrust at all levels of society.\nAs I stated before, Internet and satellite television are widely available throughout the country.\nI note from the documentary evidence that the right of return exists. The government has called on students, many of whom received a government subsidy, and others working abroad, to return to the country.\nColonel Qadhafi established the Revolutionary Committee in 1977 which consisted primarily of youths who guard against political dissent.\nLibya has a highly active Intelligence Service that operates both inside and outside the country to ensure Qadhafi's security. The services also monitor each other. Recent evidence indicates that these Intelligence Service methods are less generalized but now focus more directly on clearly defined opposition groups and individuals.\nIt is important, in my opinion, to note the control routines used in Libya on departures of travellers. The documentary evidence is quite explicit about this. There are very strict control routines for travellers exiting Libya that apply to all travellers, but particularly Libyans. Passengers travelling out of Tripoli are subjected to between four and five checks. Passports are also checked on actually boarding the plane. Some of these routines are partly computer aided.\nHowever, the documentary evidence states there has been a gradual softening of societal conditions with regard to the authority's attitudes towards its citizens. One of the signs of greater openness to the outside world is the lifting of a ban on satellite reception, meaning that satellite dishes can now be seen on virtually every roof.\nThe establishment of Internet cafes in several locations has also made it easier for Libyans to communicate with each other and with the outside world.\nI note as well from the documentary evidence that an application for asylum abroad will not, in itself, put a Libyan at risk on returning to Libya.\nThis evidence also states that Libyans do not need an exit permit to leave the country.\nCredibility of the claimant's assertions\nThe claimant's assertions and evidence are now assessed in light of this documentary evidence to determine whether the claimant faces more than a mere possibility of persecution in Libya for his perceived political opinion.\nI find that the claimant has failed to provide sufficient credible evidence that he will be persecuted for the following reasons.\nViewing the Internet in Libya is not illegal. The documentary evidence indicates that satellite dishes on roofs of homes are everywhere. I suspect that thousands and thousands of people in Libya view the Internet every day. It is obvious to me therefore that these opposition websites are also available to anyone who wants to view them. Most, if not all, of the searches that were done by the claimant were done while he was alone in his home. All of the searches were done in the presence of his trusted friends and any conversations he may have had about these sites were also in the presence of his trusted friends.\nI find it reasonable to expect that none of the claimant's trusted friends would turn informer and tell the authorities that he had searched these websites, particularly in view of the evidence that these trusted friends also had viewed the very same websites themselves.\nThe claimant could not identify or tell me whom he suspected was the informer (if there was such an informer).\nI am of the opinion that, by allowing these opposition websites to exist and by allowing the average Libyan citizen to view these websites, the Libyan government security forces were not concerned who in fact was doing the searching. There would be no reason therefore why the Intelligence Services would be interested in the claimant as he alleges.\nThe claimant admitted that the government would have done an intensive security check on him prior to the issuance of the government scholarship to send him to Canada to study. I find that those security checks would have revealed any opposition political leanings the claimant may have had, had he expressed such opinions to a government spy or informer, who was either present during his conversations with his friends or in earshot of these alleged conversations.\nIt is reasonable to assume that the government found nothing amiss in its extensive security checks because it did not receive any adverse information concerning his political beliefs prior to his coming to Canada.\nThe claimant alleges that he was not scrutinized at the Tripoli airport when he left in XXXXX 2002. I do not accept that evidence as credible in light of the documentary evidence. It is clear there are very strict control routines. The claimant would have been subjected to between four to five checks and his passport would have been checked as well as he boarded the plane.\nThe claimant denies such checks were carried out when he left Libya. I do not accept his evidence as credible in that regard and I accept the information contained in the documentary evidence.\nI do not accept the claimant's evidence that the reason he was able to leave Libya was because the report on his alleged political beliefs arrived too late for the authorities to act on it.\nHaving found his evidence not to be credible in that regard, I find, as a fact, that no such report was made or even existed.\nI do not accept as credible the claimant's assertions that the security police arrived at his parents' home the very same day he called his parents on October 7. If I were to accept his evidence as credible in that regard, then I would have to find that it was just a mere coincidence that the authorities missed the claimant at the airport and just a mere coincidence that they arrived at his home too late on the first day of his stay in Canada.\nI find that the claimant concocted the story about the alleged telephone call to his parents and the alleged visit by the authorities to his home. To me, it would not have been credible for any of the claimant's trusted friends to turn him in. There is no evidence before me that I find credible to suggest that a spy or informer overheard any conversations the claimant may have had with his trusted friends.\nAs well, I do not believe that the security forces went to the claimant's parents' home as he alleges. I say that because the claimant was unable to tell me the number of persons who arrived, whether these persons were male or female, the claimant had no idea how these persons were dressed, or how long they stayed in his parents' home or how they arrived there. In my opinion, a reasonably prudent individual would have sought out at least some of this information from his father, if, in fact, the incident occurred.\nI find much of the claimant's evidence as it related to his activities post 1998 to be vague and uncertain. He was unsure of the date he started his computer studies. He was unsure as to the dates he commenced and ended his military training. The claimant produced no diplomas for any of the computer institutions he attended to prove that he had graduated from any of those institutions.\nI do not accept his evidence as either credible or reasonable when he stated he did not bring the diplomas or certificates with him because he did not believe he needed them or would be asked to produce them.\nThe claimant admits that he is not a member of any opposition group in Libya or elsewhere. Therefore, in my opinion, he is an unknown individual to the Libyan authorities insofar as his political beliefs are concerned. It is the perceived political opinion of the persecutor, which is relevant. I find that the Libyan authorities would not perceive the claimant as a political opponent merely because he surfed the Internet and viewed opposition group sites as he alleges he did.\nThe claimant's counsel, Mr. Rahman, suggested to me during his submissions that maybe there had been a mistake made by the security personnel when they checked the claimant's background before the issuance of the scholarship by the government.\nMr. Rahman also suggested that maybe security did not check the claimant's background at all and that the claimant was \"just lucky\" in getting out of Libya.\nI do not accept Mr. Rahman's submissions in that regard as credible. The government of Libya, with all of its extensive security apparatus, including People's Committees, local Revolutionary Committees, and Purification Committees (to name a few), would not let the claimant slip through their fingers if, in fact, the claimant posed any type of threat whatsoever to dictator Colonel Al-Qadhafi.\nDeclaration at the Port of Entry\nWhen the claimant made his application for refugee protection at the Canadian border, he was examined by an Immigration Officer. The said officer made a record of that examination. Both the claimant and the examining officer signed this document.7\nIn that record, the claimant was asked to explain, in his own words, why he was seeking refugee status in Canada. The claimant responded as follows: \"Gov't is dictatorial. That he believes in democracy and feels targeted.\"\nThe record shows that during this interview, there was an interpreter by the name of Mohamed Delmar who was present and interpreted in Arabic for the claimant. The claimant did not tell the Immigration Officer that the Libyan authorities had in fact, targeted him. He only stated that he felt the authorities targeted him.\nIn my opinion, if the claimant knew that the Libyan security authorities had come to his parents' home in Libya on XXXXX and they were looking for him as he alleges, it would be reasonable to expect that the claimant would have in response to the aforesaid question told the Immigration Officer that the Libyan Intelligence had just been at his parents' home and were looking for him. I would expect that the claimant would also have told the Immigration Officer that the Libyan Intelligence had accused him of working against the government and its people and threatened, that if he were to return to Libya, the government stated his punishment would be severe and that they could execute him. These are the very words his father allegedly told him during the course of that telephone conversation.\nIf the claimant truly feared that he could be executed upon his return to Libya (as promised by the Libyan authorities), this would have been the most important information for him to convey to the Immigration Officer.\nThe Honourable Judge Teitelbaum in Jumriany8 confirms that it is reasonable for the CRDD (now RPD) to conclude the claimant's lack of credibility on the basis of false statements made to the Immigration Officer at the Port of Entry.\n\"The Panel notes his membership lies in the heart of his refugee claim. Yet, he failed to mention this key point in his reply to the questions of the Immigration Officer at the Port of Entry. The Panel finds it difficult to understand why a person who is seeking the protection of a foreign country would lie (or not tell the truth) to an official of this foreign country about the very reason he seeks the country's protection.\"\nIn my opinion therefore, had the claimant been threatened with death on his return as he alleges, he would have definitely told that to the Immigration Officer. I find it reasonable to conclude that the reason the claimant did not tell the Immigration Officer of the threat of death if he returned was because the threat was never made during the alleged telephone conversation with his father on XXXXX, 2002.\nFor all of the above reasons, I find that the claimant failed to provide sufficient credible evidence that he has a well-founded fear of persecution for any ground in the definition of a Convention refugee.\nDETERMINATION\nFor all of these reasons, and after listening to all of the claimant's evidence, as well as the observations and submissions made to me, and after considering all of the relevant documentary evidence, I find XXXXX XXXXXX XXXXXXX not to be a Convention refugee as he does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in Libya.\nGiven my findings above regarding the lack of credibility of the claimant's evidence, I also find that the claimant is not a person in need of protection in that his removal to Libya would not subject him personally to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, and in that there are no substantial grounds to believe that his removal to Libya would subject him personally to a danger of torture.\nI therefore reject his claim\n\"William M.

She claims to have a well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of government authorities by reason of political opinion. In addition, she claims to be a person in need of protection as a person in danger of being tortured or at risk of losing her life or being subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Angola.\nAllegations\nThe claimant alleged\n(1) in 1992, her father was killed by members of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) because he was believed to be a supporter of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA); her father was not a member of UNITA; [see page 7]\n(2) in early 1995, she was hired by XXXXXX, a bi-weekly newspaper known for criticizing the government;\n(3) on XXXXX, 2001, police raided the offices of the paper but she was not working that day and later discovered that she was wanted by police \"dead or alive\" because she was believed to be a supporter of UNITA;\n(4) she left Angola XXXXX, 2001 using a Zimbabwean passport;\n(5) since her arrival in Canada, her mother has told her that police had questioned her as to her (the claimant's) whereabouts;\n(6) she fears for her life if she were to return to Angola.\nDetermination\nThe panel finds that the claimant is not a Convention refugee, as she does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in Angola. There is insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish that there is a reasonable chance she would be at risk of persecution if she were to return to Angola. In addition, the panel finds that the claimant is not a person in need of protection in that there are no substantial grounds to believe that her removal to Angola will subject her personally to a danger of torture nor is there a reasonable possibility that she faces a risk to her life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nAnalysis\nThe claimant arrived in Canada using a fraudulent passport with her picture attached. She destroyed the passport because she was told it was not necessary to keep it. The issue of personal identity was addressed at the hearing. The claimant's personal identity was not established to the satisfaction of the panel. The panel notes that the claimant did testify in Portuguese.\nThe claimant indicated in her Personal Information Form (PIF)1 that she would disclose her birth certificate. The birth certificate is not on file. The claimant explained that her birth certificate was with Canada Immigration because she left it with the official when she had her initial interview on June 29, 2001. She repeated that she had the certificate in her possession and had given it to the official. The POE notes2 taken by the officer on that date indicate \"no identity documents - in process of getting them.\" The claimant had testified that she brought her birth certificate with her to Canada and left her other identity documents in Angola. The claimant then explained that the official had asked if she had any documents and she told the official that she had her birth certificate. The claimant added that the official told her to bring the birth certificate with her next time. The panel notes once again that the birth certificate is not on the file nor is there any evidence that the document was ever provided to Canada Immigration. The panel considered the inconsistency between the testimony of the claimant and the POE notes and finds that the explanation of the claimant is not acceptable. That and the fact that the birth certificate has not been put into evidence by the claimant when it is apparently available leads the panel to make a negative inference as to the claimant's identity.\nThe identity documents3 submitted by the claimant were sent for forensic examination. The results of the examination were inconclusive. The report indicated that there were no genuine specimens available for comparison and that there was no information on the production and issuance of the documents submitted, a national identity card and an employment card from her newspaper. Neither documents had any security features. Due to a lack of security features and overall poor quality of printing and manufacture, the authenticity of these documents could not be established by the testing. Counsel submitted that because the forensic results were inconclusive and, lacking evidence that the documents are not genuine, the panel should not question the authenticity of the documents. However, given the panel's finding regarding the failure to provide her birth certificate, the panel finds that the results are just as described \"inconclusive\" and gives them little or no weight.\nTwo letters4 allegedly from her boyfriend have no corroborative value as to the claimant's personal identity.\nRule 7, of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), which is authorized by subsection 100(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), clearly requires claimants to provide \"acceptable documents establishing identity and other elements of the claim.\" The commentary to Rule 7 also states that \"documents establishing identity\" should be interpreted as being broader than just identity documents such as birth certificate or passport and includes other documents that indicate the claimant's personal status. This claim was referred on October 25, 2001. The claimant had the benefit of legal counsel. The panel finds that the claimant did not exercise reasonable diligence in obtaining documents to corroborate her identity. The panel draws a negative inference regarding the credibility of the claimant.\nEven if the panel were to accept that the claimant is a national of Angola on the basis of her language, her personal and professional identities have not been satisfactorily established.\nThe last article5 in a collection of articles disclosed by the claimant concerns the incident of the attacks on civilians in Caxito. This incident, its coverage and the resulting arrests are significant elements of the claim. The claimant indicated in her narrative that XXXXX published what they considered to be the true version of what happened. The claimant explained that she asked her boyfriend to get a copy of the article from the XXXXX offices but he was too afraid to go there. This controversial article, which caused the raid on the newspaper offices, resulting in the arrest of the employees and the claimant's flight from Angola, is an important document with significant corroborative value. The panel finds that there were other avenues available to the claimant to obtain the article such as libraries, the internet, or a request to XXXXX. These actions would not endanger anyone. Once again, the panel finds that the claimant was not diligent in obtaining corroborative evidence and draws a negative inference regarding her overall credibility6. The panel accepts that the Caxito incident did, indeed, happen but finds the claimant failed to establish that XXXXXX wrote an article which then led to the alleged police action against the paper.\nThe claimant testified that the arrested employees were suspected of being UNITA supporters. There is no independent corroborative evidence of the Sunday, XXXXX, 2001 incident in the documentary evidence consulted by the panel. The United States Department of State Country Report of Human Rights Practices for 20017, states that the government of Angola did not generally interfere with the activities of the foreign media. It also states that several international organizations have a permanent presence in the country. The panel finds that if the XXXXX, 2001, incident took place at the XXXXX offices and was as serious as alleged by the claimant, there would be some mention of it in the documentary evidence before the panel. The panel finds that there is not sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish that the incident alleged by the claimant actually took place.\nThe panel also considered the two letters allegedly from the claimant's boyfriend8. The apparent purpose of the letters was to corroborate the beating of the claimant's boyfriend at the hands of police when they came to his home looking for the claimant and the continued police interest in the claimant. The handwriting in these two letters is blatantly dissimilar though they purport to be written by the same person. The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that they were written by two different persons and were fabricated to purposely mislead the panel. The panel also considered the vested interest of the alleged author. The panel finds that the letters are unreliable, self-serving and gives them no weight. The panel also finds that there is not sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish that the police were actually looking for the claimant or that they assaulted the claimant's boyfriend or are interested in the claimant at this time.\nThe preceding credibility findings lead the panel to discount the testimony of the claimant regarding her mother's information about XXXXX 2001 visit from police concerning the whereabouts of her daughter.\nThe panel finds that there is not sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish there is a reasonable chance that the claimant would be at risk of persecution if she were to return to Angola.\nIn the alternative, the claimant testified that after publication of a controversial article by XXXX, a privately owned newspaper in XXXXXX, police raided the offices and some employees were detained and questioned. Documentary evidence submitted by the claimant and the board indicates that the situation for media in Angola was and is very difficult. The articles9 disclosed by the claimant quote journalists, editors and owners of newspapers. Another article in this disclosure indicates that William Tonet, managing editor of a privately owned newspaper has been harassed, arrested, questioned and released. The panel notes that the owner of the weekly is still, as far as is known, in Angola. A reporter, named by the claimant, was arrested and detained, went on a hunger strike, and was released after a month. He was harassed, charged, convicted and has launched an appeal to the Supreme Court. He is free, awaiting the result of his appeal. These articles dealt with difficulties experienced by high profile members of the media prior to the time described by the claimant. The panel finds, based on all the documentary evidence concerning the situation of media in Angola, that owners, editors and high profile journalists are at risk of serious mistreatment.\nThe claimant alleged she was employed by XXXXX. She believes she would be jailed upon her return to Angola because she ran away and it will make her look suspicious and authorities will think she knows more than she does. The claimant was not a journalist. She was XXXXXXX to an administrator who was involved in the paper's financial matters such as salaries. She did not type stories nor was she involved in any editorial meetings. The claimant indicated in her narrative that she was aware of journalists who were associated with XXXXXX and the difficulties they were having. The panel notes that this information is in a variety of news and human rights publications. The panel notes, again, that there is no reference in the documentary evidence to the XXXXX, 2001 incident. She was also aware of visits from the police to the newspaper office, threatening letters, and anonymous phone calls to the newspaper. The harassment of the media and the form it takes is also public knowledge. The panel finds that the claimant would not be of interest to police because of any knowledge she may possess. The claimant testified that she and receptionists were often rudely treated or ignored by police when they came to the office to see her boss or the owner. There was no evidence of the claimant being specifically targeted or seriously mistreated by police for any reason prior to the XXXXX, 2001, incident. The panel finds that the claimant does not have a sufficiently high professional profile to be of interest to those she fears.\nThe claimant testified that she does not know what authorities will do to her if she were to return. She added she did not know this because they did not take her when they were looking for her. She testified that authorities may believe that she has spoken against the government. The panel finds the vague fears of the claimant to be speculation. Even if the claimant worked for the paper, as alleged, the panel finds that the profile of the claimant is not one to attract the attention of those she alleges to fear. The panel also considered the passage of time. The panel finds that the claimant is of no interest to the authorities by reason of being a former XXXXXX employee, which was the central issue of her claim.\nThe panel considered all of the evidence. The panel concludes that the claimant has failed to fulfill her onus of providing sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish that there is a reasonable chance that she would be at risk of persecution at the hands of government authorities by reason of political opinion.\nThe panel also considered the allegation regarding the death of the claimant's father in 1992. Her father was killed by members of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) because he was believed to be a supporter of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). The claimant clarified at the hearing that her father was not a member of UNITA and that the incident was a result of a problem within the family. As well, there was no evidence or suggestion of any problems for her between 1992 and 2001 in relation to the death of her father.\nThe panel notes that a person in need of protection must establish that removal to the country of reference would subject them personally to the harm feared. The panel then considered the elements of S.97(1)(a). There is no evidence of the claimant being tortured or mistreated by a public official or a person acting in an official capacity or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of such a person in the past. Having considered all of the evidence, the panel finds the principal claimant has failed to demonstrate sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish that there exist substantial grounds to believe that she would be subjected personally to a danger of torture if she were to return to Angola.\nThe panel considered the elements under S.(97)(1)(b). The panel also finds for the reasons already given there is not sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish that there is a reasonable chance that the claimant faces a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if she were to return to Angola.\nConclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, the panel determines that XXXXXXXXXXXXXX is not a Convention refugee and not a person in need of protection and therefore rejects her claim.\n\"Marnie Armstrong\"\nMarnie Armstrong\nDATED: 29 September 2003\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - EVIDENCE - DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE - DOCUMENTATION - CREDIBILITY - IDENTITY - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION RULES - POLITICAL OPINION - CITIZENSHIP - FEMALE - NEGATIVE - ANGOLA\n1 Exhibit C-1, Question 29\n2 Exhibit M-1, Page 9\n3 Exhibit C-2, Items 1 and 2\n4 Exhibit C-2, Item 3, Dated December 5, 2001 and Exhibit C-3, Item 1, Faxed February 18, 2003\n5 Ibid., Internet article: Unita Kidnapping of Children and Aid Workers...allafrica.com, June 28, 2001\n6 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, section 100(4); Refugee Protection Division Rule 7\n7 Exhibit R-1, United States Department of State Country Report of Human Rights Practices for Angola, 2001, March 4, 2002\n8 Supra, Footnote #4\n9 Exhibit C-1, Attachment: Media Situation Deteriorates in Angola July 9, 2001\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRPD File # \/ No. dossier SPR : CA1-00751\n1\nRPD File # \/ No. dossier SPR : CA1-00751\n3\n",

The claimant also claims to be a person in need of protection pursuant to sections 97(1)(a) and\/or (b) of the Act.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant has been indicted in the United States on charges of conspiracy to import marijuana. The claimant was subsequently arrested in XXXX 2001. He alleged that a \"customs\" officer threatened him in transit to a detention centre by saying that he had \"no idea of what kind of deep and dark places he could be put in with the worst kind of violent people\".\nThe claimant alleged that the evidence against him is unsubstantiated in relation to the conspiracy indictment. His evidence is that it is not difficult for the prosecution to prove involvement in a conspiracy. The claimant alleged that he would fall under mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines if convicted.\nThe claimant was to attend at a hearing on XXXXX 2001 in XXXXXXX, Montana, but failed to appear. He testified that he failed to appear because he feared that his bail could be revoked.\nThe claimant came into Canada on the Pacific Crest trail, having waited until the snow melted and hiked across the border. He went to stay with his girlfriend in Squamish. The claimant did not report to Canadian authorities immediately because he was afraid of what would happen if he did. The claimant was aware of a Convention refugee claim made by an American charged with drug offences in the United Sates. It was the claimant's intention to claim refugee status in Canada, although he waited until after he was arrested on criminal charges in Canada before he made his claim.\nThe claimant alleged that mandatory minimum sentencing in the United States amounts to cruel and unusual punishment. The claimant believes that the war on drugs is unjust, and that it compromises the integrity of the United States constitution.\nThe claimant further alleged that a judge could override a jury verdict convicting him of an offence relating to a lesser amount of drugs, and substitute a guilty verdict over the full amount of drugs involved in the offence.\nThe claimant fears prison conditions in the United States, specifically overcrowding, no personal space, violence in prisons, and sanitary conditions.\nThe claimant alleged that those who do not cooperate with the authorities receive double the sentence of those who do cooperate.\nThe claimant was offered a plea bargain of seven years in exchange for a guilty plea. He would, at least, have to serve six years of such a sentence in the federal prison system.\nThe claimant's evidence was that one of his co-accused was given a seven year reduction in his sentence for agreeing to testify against the claimant on the conspiracy indictment. He is serving seven years.\nThe claimant was previously charged with domestic violence. He received six months probation after pleading guilty, and was required to take an anger management class. In 2001, the claimant was charged with conspiracy to import marijuana. He pleaded guilty to numerous drug related charges in Canada, and offences related to forgery of credit cards and documents and possession to a vehicle obtained by commission of an offence. The claimant pleaded guilty and was given a sentence of two years less a day, which he is currently serving at the XXXXXXX Correctional Centre.\nANALYSIS\nThe panel first considered whether the claimant's fear of persecution in the United States is well-founded.\nThe claimant fears that he will be convicted on the indictment outstanding against him, that he will face up to fourteen years imprisonment, and that he will face harsh prison conditions in a federal institution in the United States. He contends that mandatory minimum sentencing amounts to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nThe claimant's belief following his arrest was that there was no case against him and that charges would be dropped. His court appointed attorney advised him he could be convicted on the conspiracy charge on the testimony of the co-accused without physical evidence.\nThe claimant's evidence was that the conspiracy charge involved more than one hundred kilograms of marijuana. The claimant alleged that he was advised by his court appointed attorney that he would face a mandatory minimum sentence of five years. He is charged under federal law. The claimant's attorney advised him to tell what he knew in the hopes of getting a break in sentencing. The claimant told his attorney that he knew nothing. The claimant testified that under the circumstances, \"he was basically screwed\". The claimant was released on bail and subsequently fled to Canada.\nThe panel first considered whether the claimant faces prosecution under a law of general application or persecution in the United States. It finds that the claimant is liable to prosecution under an indictment for a serious drug offence, that is, alleged criminal activity. Whether he opposes the war on drugs and mandatory minimum sentencing in the panel's view has no impact on his ability to get a fair trial in the United States. In the panel's view, the claimant faces prosecution in relation to an alleged criminal offence, and not persecution under the Convention refugee definition.\nThe claimant was asked why, given that he had no involvement in the offence alleged in the Montana indictment and that he is not guilty of the offence, he does not wish to face trial, and be found to be not guilty. The claimant testified that he found out that ninety percent of criminal cases in the US are resolved through plea bargains. Only one percent of accused are acquitted. Further, the prosecution would not provide full disclosure of the case against him. The witnesses would not be named until the trial date, and there was no way for him to mount a defense. He learned this information from the Federal Defendant's Handbook.\nThe panel takes judicial notice that the United States is a large-standing constitutional democracy with an independent judiciary and a highly developed legal system. The constitution ensures the right to a fair trial. The panel finds that the claimant has the right to a fair trial, to mount a defense to the charges against him, and to have legal representation throughout.1\nThe panel considered the claimant's evidence, but finds that although the claimant may face prosecution for a criminal offence in the U.S., that he would not face persecution were he now to return to the U.S. to stand trial on the charges that he faces. If convicted, the claimant would face punishment for commission of a criminal offence, and not persecution under the\nConvention refugee definition.\nThe panel notes that it is the claimant's evidence that under the plea bargain offered to him, he faced seven years imprisonment. His evidence is that because he skipped bail and fled to Canada, he would now face a sentence of fourteen years in relation to the offence for which he has been accused. The panel notes that the claimant is accused on conspiracy charges relating to the importation of marijuana. The claimant's evidence was that the alleged offence involves over one hundred kilograms. The amount of drugs in question is significant. The panel considered the potential sentence faced by the claimant if he is convicted on the conspiracy charge.2 The panel takes judicial notice that the importing of illegal drugs is a serious offence, and those convicted of such charges are subject to lengthy jail sentences in many jurisdictions. In this context, the panel notes that the international community has condemned the illicit drug trade. In the panel's view a sentence of seven to fourteen years imprisonment does not exceed international standards. The panel finds that if the claimant were convicted and sentenced to seven years or even fourteen years as the claimant alleges, that this sentence is not disproportionate to the offence for which the claimant stands accused.\nThe claimant was asked whether the officer who \"threatened\" him had any jurisdiction in Montana. The claimant testified that he believed that he has jurisdiction in any state. Although the panel is prepared to accept the claimant's evidence in relation to there having been a threat made by a customs officer against him, it finds that there is no more than a mere possibility that a customs officer in Washington state could make good on such a threat, in particular, where the indictment against the claimant will be heard in the state of Montana. The panel does not accept that a lone customs officer has jurisdiction or authority to determine where an individual charged with a federal offence will serve his sentence if convicted.\nThe panel notes that the claimant did not publicly express his political opinion in the US against the war on drugs, although he talked about this opposition to friends privately, who were aware of his views.\nThere is no evidence that the claimant has spoken out publicly against the war on drugs in the United States. There is insufficient evidence that the courts or authorities of the U.S. would take an interest in the claimant holding or expressing such opinions. There is insufficient evidence before the panel to indicate that the claimant would be targeted for holding any political\nopinions were he to return to the United States.\nThere is insufficient evidence upon which to make a finding that the claimant would face disproportionate punishment for reasons of his opposition to the war on drugs, amounting to persecution under the Convention refugee definition. The panel finds that the claimant, if found guilty, would be convicted under a law of general application for purely criminal acts and that prosecution has no nexus to the Convention refugee definition.\nFor all of these reasons, the panel finds the claimant not to be a Convention refugee.\nThe panel next considered whether there is a serious possibility that the claimant would face a risk to life, or danger of torture or of cruel or unusual treatment or punishment were he now to return to the United States.\nFor the same reasons outlined above, the panel finds that if the claimant is convicted and sentenced to between seven and fourteen years imprisonment for conspiracy, that this sentence does not amount to torture, or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. In the panel's view, the potential sentence is inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions and is not disproportionate to the offence alleged, and accordingly does not amount to cruel or unusual treatment or punishment. The potential sentence in the panel's view does not shock the conscience, it is not disproportionate, and is not contrary to international standards.\nThe claimant further fears prison conditions in the United States, specifically overcrowding, no personal space, violence in prisons, and unsanitary conditions. The panel again notes that the claimant has not been convicted of the offence alleged. If he is found guilty he is likely to face a lengthy prison sentence in a federal prison. The panel has reviewed the documentary evidence before it in relation to prison conditions in federal prisons in the United States.3 It notes that the documentary evidence indicates that federal prisons are overcrowded. There is evidence of violence in United States federal prisons. The panel finds however, that the level of violence in federal prisons in the United States has not reached such a level, that there is a serious possibility that the claimant would face a risk to life, or danger of torture or cruel or unusual treatment or punishment were he to return to the United States and be convicted and sentenced to a lengthy term in a federal prison. Although overcrowding in federal prisons is a serious problem, and sanitary conditions from the documentary evidence4 leave much room for improvement and can be characterized as harsh, in the panel's view, the conditions in federal prisons do not amount to torture, or cruel or unusual treatment or punishment. The conditions do not shock the conscience, and do not fall below international standards for persons detained having been convicted for serious criminal offences. Further in this context, the panel notes that the claimant's imprisonment would be pursuant to lawful sanctions.\nThe panel finds that there is insufficient evidence before it upon which to make a finding that there is a serious possibility that the claimant would face a danger of torture were he now to return to the United States.\nFor all of these reasons, the panel finds the claimant not to be a person in need of protection.\n\"Andrew Rozdilsky\"\nAndrew Rozdilsky\nDATED: 08 May 2003\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - PERSECUTION - PARTICULAR SOCIAL GROUP - POLITICAL OPINION - LAW OF GENERAL APPLICATION - PERSON IN NEED OF PROTECTION - MALE - NEGATIVE - UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\n1 Exhibit R-1, Item #2, Constitution of the United States\n2 Exhibit R-1, Item #5\n3 Exhibit R-1, Item C2\n4 Ibid\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRPD File # \/ No. dossier SPR : CA2-00788\n6\n",

He is a citizen of both Russia and Greece. His wife is 36 years old. She is a citizen of Greece, as are her two children, XXXXX and XXXXXXXXX, who are 15 and 12 years old, respectively.\nThey left their country at different times to come to Canada. The principal claimant left Russia in XXXXX 1999 to go to Greece, which he then left on XXXXX 22, 2000. The rest of the family left Greece on XXXXX, 2000.\nThey all claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution based, in the case of the principal claimant, on political opinion in both Russia and Greece and, in the case of the other family members, on membership in a particular social group (family).\nWhen the hearing began, the female claimant was designated to represent her children, who are still minors.\nIt should be stated that only the principal claimant and his wife answered question 37 of their Personal Information Form (PIF), the children having based their claims on those of their parents.\nSUMMARY OF FACTS ALLEGED\nThe claimants alleged the following in support of their claim.\nAs regards the principal claimant, he was born in XXXXX, Georgia, which was then a republic of the former Soviet Union.\nHe moved to Moscow in 1978 and then to Podolsk in 1986 following his marriage to the female claimant. He started a XXXXX business that became very successful. His success made people around him jealous, and his family started having problems as of that time. At school, his son was harassed and assaulted by other students.\nIn 1992, he was elected the XXXXXXXX of the Entrepreneurs Union for the Moscow Regional XXXXX.\nBecause of his political involvement and his family's problems, he decided to send his family to Greece.\nIn 1995, having stayed in Podolsk, he was designated by the city's Entrepreneurs Union as a candidate for the position of XXXXXXXX for the region. He came second in the elections but made many enemies. His activities in the Entrepreneurs Union and his success in business made him highly visible.\nIn XXXXXX 1997, XXX XXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXX of the city of Moscow for his contribution to the development of Moscow and the region.\nIn 1999, he ran again for the position of chief of administration of the Moscow region. During the election campaign, he criticized the existing administration, which suggested that he pull out of the elections and promised to appoint him to the position of commerce assistant after the elections. He refused. In the meantime, he had increased his business activities and owned a complex XXXX XXXXX XXXXXX where major meetings in the region were held and where officials of government institutions, people from the militia, the bourgeoisie of the region and mafia leaders could very often be found.\nThey booked rooms to enjoy themselves in the company of prostitutes. However, the principal claimant took care to record everything on his surveillance cameras and other hidden cameras.\nWhen the existence of the recordings became public, he was ordered to hand them over. The militia raided his business premises on the pretext of looking for weapons. His premises were searched, and all the recordings found there, along with his personal computer and notebooks, were seized. The same thing occurred at his home.\nHe was called to the public prosecutor's office, and the prosecutor's assistant asked him to hand over the videotapes he had in his possession.\nIt was therefore in this context that, fearing for his life, he abandoned everything to join his family in Greece in XXXXX 1999.\nThe day after he arrived in that country, he began receiving telephone calls from Russia that again concerned the recovery of the tapes. At first, an offer was made to buy them back from him for $100,000 and then $200,000, which he refused. Death threats were made against him, and it was made clear to him that he could easily be traced.\nOn XXXXX 1999, an attempt was made to kidnap him. Among his assailants, he recognized an individual who had come from Russia. He resisted that kidnapping attempt, drawing the attention of his neighbours, who threatened to call the police. His assailants hit him and then withdrew. The principal claimant went to the police, but this had no effect.\nHe continued getting calls threatening to attack him and his family. That is what led him to leave Greece on XXXXX, 2000 to come to Canada.\nWhile he was in Canada, he received a call from his wife on XXXXXX, 2000 to tell him that a stranger had tried to kidnap his daughter as she was leaving school.\nTurning now to the female claimant and her children, their problems started after the principal claimant's arrival in Greece. His family and relatives began receiving threatening telephone calls.\nOn XXXXX, 2000, the female claimant got a call from a man who wanted to know where her husband was. The next day, her daughter was almost kidnapped by a stranger. She too laid a complaint with the police, but it did not lead anywhere. For the safety of herself and her children, she had to leave Greece with them to join her husband in Canada.\nANALYSIS\nAfter reviewing all the testimonial and documentary evidence in light of the definition of \"Convention refugee\",1 we have concluded that the principal claimant has proved that he has a well-founded fear of being persecuted if he returns to Russia.\nA well-founded fear of persecution in Greece has not been proved by either the principal claimant or his wife and children.\nThis is because they have not established clearly and convincingly that the Greek state is unable to protect them, as required by Ward.2\nIt should be stated at the outset that the panel declares itself satisfied with the claimants' identity based on the exhibits filed at the hearing.\nMerits of the claim\nTo begin with, it should be noted that what the claimants say they fear in Greece is the presence of Russian nationals who allegedly entered that country to try to attack them.\nOn this point, although the claimants referred to the many threatening telephone calls they allegedly received either personally or through family members, their claim is based mainly on the two kidnapping attempts already mentioned. Moreover, those two incidents were what made them turn to the police.\nFirst, the principal claimant stated that he was almost kidnapped on XXXXX, 1999 by strangers, one of whom he allegedly recognized as one of his persecutors from Russia.\nThe second incident involved an alleged kidnapping attempt on his daughter as well as she was leaving school on XXXXX, 2000.\nIn the first case, the principal claimant explained that he resisted the kidnapping attempt and that the noise of the fight drew the neighbours, who called the police.\nWhen the police arrived on the scene, they called an ambulance to take him to the hospital. They took note of the incident and asked him a few questions. He was able to give them the name of the assailant he had recognized as well as the make (BMW) and colour (dark green) of the car his assailants had gotten into.\nHe added that the police officer in charge of the case even went to the hospital to meet him and ask him to go to the station to make a more complete statement once he was out of the hospital. He did so once he had recovered, but he said that it did not lead anywhere.\nIn this connection, it must be recalled that countries are not required to achieve results in every case. The Federal Court of Appeal has already noted the limits on the protection that states owe their citizens in Villafranca,3 in which it stressed the following:\nNo government that makes any claim to democratic values or protection of human rights can guarantee the protection of all of its citizens at all times. Thus, it is not enough for a claimant merely to show that his government has not always been effective at protecting persons in his particular situation.\nIn this case, the principal claimant does seem to have understood this, since he himself explained the difficulties that his case presented for the police. In his answer to question 37 of his Personal Information Form (PIF), he said that he thought the insufficiency of the information he was able to provide certainly explained why the police had not achieved results quickly. He also stated the following:\n[Translation] I went to the police to ask for protection and assistance. They could not open the criminal file because of the absence of concrete surnames and given names. The check done after I told the police the Russian name of one of my assailants did not yield anything. That person probably used false papers during his stay in Greece.\nHowever, overlooking these considerations, he seems to have glossed over the facts that he himself raised to conclude that the Greek state is unable to protect him and his family. He argued that Greece, which has a small population, cannot arrest Russian nationals who have come illegally into that country in large numbers. In the same vein, his counsel cited the documentation, but only incompletely, to draw his own conclusions about the inability of the Greek state to protect its citizens.\nIn the submissions4 he provided to the panel after the hearing, he referred to the hundreds of people who stay in Greece illegally. Further on, he stated that the government generally does not seek out those individuals in order to deport them. Based on those observations, he concluded that there was a collusion of sorts by the state in the settling in Greece of Russian nationals who had come there to persecute the principal claimant and his family.\nHowever, the text cited, when read in full, seems to say something completely different.5 First, it does not refer to Russians at all but rather to people coming from Turkey, Iraq and Iran. As well, it is clearly explained that the people who have stayed illegally and are not sought for deportation are those from Turkey, since the Greek government did not have an agreement with the Turkish government allowing it to return those illegal persons to Turkey until XXXXXX 2001.\nHowever, continuing his argument, the claimants' counsel also referred to Exhibit S-21,6 which states that some Greek police officers are tied to criminals. On that basis, referring to Klinko,7 he concluded that the Greek state is colluding in the corruption of those police officers.\nThis is once again a rather hasty and unjustified conclusion given that it has not been established that the corruption found in some police officers extends to the state level.\nAs the Federal Court stated in Kadenko:8\nOnce it is assumed that the state . . . has political and judicial institutions capable of protecting its citizens, it is clear that the refusal of certain police officers to take action cannot in itself make the state incapable of doing so.\nThis applies perfectly to Greece, which is known to be a democratic state.\nThat being said, the panel finds that the principal claimant has not succeeded in proving that the Greek state is unable to protect him.\nTurning now to the second incident, namely the attempted kidnapping of the principal claimant's daughter, it must be noted that, according to the female claimant's testimony, the incident occurred on XXXX, 2000 and she did not complain to the police until XXXX, six days later. She said that her statement was officially recorded. However, she did not follow up on it, since she left Greece to come to Canada four days after the statement, that is, on XXXX, 2000, without trying to find out what had been done about the complaint.\nIn his submissions, the claimants' counsel noted that the principal claimant and his wife did not want to take the risk of availing themselves of Greece's protection following that kidnapping because of the arguments that have already been elaborated on concerning the first kidnapping, that is, the kidnapping of the principal claimant. However, these are arguments of which we have already disposed.\nIn the circumstances, we repeat the conclusion we have already drawn: the claimants have not succeeded in establishing clearly and convincingly that the Greek state is unable to protect them.\nThe panel therefore finds that the principal claimant and his wife have not been able to prove that there is a reasonable chance they would be persecuted if they returned to Greece.\nThe same conclusion applies to the children, since their claim is based on that of their parents.\nIt should be noted at this point that this case began on May 3, 2002. It was adjourned several times and, at the last hearing on October 30, 2002, the claimants' counsel filed an answer to question 559 mentioning the grounds under paragraphs 97(1)(a) and (b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, namely a danger of torture for the claimants within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture, a risk to their life and a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if they return to their country.\nHowever, that provision is not applicable in this case, which began on May 3, 2002 and thus well before June 28, 2002, the date on which the new Act came into force (s. 191).\nDECISION\nAccordingly, the Refugee Division determines that the principal claimant,\nXXXXXXXXXXXXX, his wife XXXXXXXXX and his children XXXXXXXXXXX and\nXXXXXXXXXXXX are not Convention refugees as defined by section 2(1) of the Immigration Act.\nMe Yves Boisrond\nMe Yves Boisrond\nConcurred in by:\nMe Donald Archambault\nMe Donal Archambault\nDated at Montreal this 5th day of March 2003\n\/dl\nREFUGEE DIVISION - POLITICAL OPINION - STATE PROTECTION - DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE - IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEE PROTECTION ACT - SECTION 97(1)(a) AND (b) - MALE - FEMALE - NEGATIVE - RUSSIA - GREECE\n1 \"Convention refugee\" is defined in section 2(1) of the Immigration Act partly as follows:\n\"Convention refugee\" means any person who\n(a) by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,\n(i) is outside the country of the person's nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country, or. . . .\n2 Canada (Attorney General) v.

Allegations\nIn support of his claim for refugee protection, the claimant said that he had joined the Christian Democratic National Peasant's Party in early 1990. The party's ideology was anti-communist. The claimant allegedly held the positions of advisor XXXXXXXX of the party (CDNPP) and was a XXXX in Bucharest sector XX.\nDuring the XXXXX of 1995 he was allegedly a journalist for the XXXXX newspaper and published very critical articles about the Iliescu regime and the secret service. He also said that after he joined the CDNPP, he was followed and under the surveillance of the secret police. He said they tried to kidnap him, investigated his activities, opened his XXXXXXX letters, tried to recruit him for the secret police, stole personal documents and so forth.\nIn 1996, the claimant allegedly became a consultant to XXXXXXXXXXXXXX of the Romanian Republic. He allegedly drew up a plan for the XXXX XXXX XXXXXX XXXX XXXXX. He wanted to show that the overthrow of Ceausescu was a pro-soviet coup d'\u00e9tat rather than a revolution, and he allegedly encouraged a witness to write a report, which he presented to the president of the republic. The report was published in the XXXX on XXXX, 1999, although it had been circulating for two years. The day after it was published, the claimant allegedly denounced the ambivalent attitude of the XXXXXXXXX.\nIn an interview on XXXXX, he allegedly told all he knew about the coup d'\u00e9tat against Ceausescu and its organizers. He allegedly gave other interviews and published an open letter. As a result of his speaking out, he allegedly received death threats and twice a stranger assaulted his XXXXXX.\nFor fear of being physically liquidated at the end of the term of president Emil Constantinescu, whom he considered as his protector and for whom he had worked as a XXXXX until XXXXX 2000, he went into exile.\n2. Claimant's identity\nThe claimant established his Romanian citizenship to the panel's satisfaction on the basis of his oral testimony and the numerous identity documents that he produced.\n3. Exclusion\nThe Minister intervened in the case to seek the exclusion of XXXXXX. He first filed exhibits in support of his request and then questioned the claimant. He then presented the following arguments to show that the claimant had been complicit in the commission of crimes against humanity in Romania.\na. The claimant had belonged to the Special Antiterrorism Unit (USLA), a branch of the Securitate, an organization with limited and brutal aims. He worked with the organization, whose activities were contrary to the goals of the United Nations, to which Romania subscribes.\nb. Given his educational level and his responsibilities, the claimant was aware of the systematic violations of human rights that this organization committed. The human rights violations included opening personal mail, wiretaps, breaking into private residences, physical violence, imprisonment and the murder of thousands of real or imagined dissidents, sending dissidents to psychiatric hospitals, electric shock torture, and administering drugs. Considering these various acts of violence, the claimant's membership in Securitate makes him complicit.\nc. The claimant was not simply following orders. He was someone who gave orders when he worked for the XXX XXXX XXXX of the USLA from 1975 to 1982. He conducted investigations. He was assigned to protect crewmembers. He was trusted by his bosses, who sent him on missions. He cannot therefore claim that he did not know what was going on.\nd. He never tried to leave the organization.\ne. He drew up a plan to reform the intelligence services, the army and the police. He could not have done so if he had not been fairly familiar with the structure of those services.\n4. Analysis\nAfter giving the claimant the opportunity to present both his oral and documentary evidence, the panel assessed the evidence to determine whether the claimant's work in the antiterrorism unit of the Department of the Interior under the Ceausescu government is sufficient reason to exclude him within the meaning of 1F(a) and 1F(c) under section 98 of the Act.\nThe panel cannot grant protection to the claimant, because he belonged to a branch of Securitate, and therefore he was complicit in the crimes against humanity committed by that organization. Because of his position as an officer, the panel finds that the claimant was aware of the objectives of Securitate and the horrible treatment it inflicted on thousands of Romanians, as shown by the documentary evidence, including M-1 (Romania, Security and Intelligences) and M-2 (Denis Deletan, Ceausescu and the Securitate: Coercion and Dissent in Romania, 1965-1989).\nIn his oral and written testimony, in particular P-3 (XXXXXXXXXX explains the key points of the KGB evidence), the claimant acknowledges his membership in the USLA, and he explains the organization's goals in P-32 (Special antiterrorism unit). He denied, however, that there was any link between Securitate and the USLA. He said that fighting terrorism is not contrary to the goals of the United Nations and each state has a role to play in the fight against terrorism so as not to become destabilized. What is at issue in this case, however, is not the sovereignty of any state to set up an institution to protect itself, but rather the claimant's complicity in the commission of crimes against humanity in a country ruled by a bloody dictatorship.\nOne need only to read what M-1 says about Securitate to understand how repressive the organization was:\n\"The Ministry of Interior's Department of State Security (Departamentul Securitatii Statului, popularly known as the Securitate) was the secret political police (...) responsible for guarding the internal and external security of the Ceausescu regime and suppressing any unrest, disturbance, or dissident group that criticized or challenged it. The Securitate succeeded in repressing most organized opposition to the regime.\"\nExhibit M-1 also shows that the repression took the form of political assassinations, sending booby-trapped packages to exiles, imprisoning opponents in psychiatric prisons, censorship, wiretapping, torture, not allowing people to apply for passports, etc.\nContrary to what the claimant said, the panel finds that the documentary evidence establishes a structural link between the USLA and Securitate. The claimant was an officer of the USLA and a lawyer by training (according to his degree filed under Exhibit P-18). He could not have been unaware that the USLA was part of Securitate, also know as Departamentul Securitatii Statului (DSS).\nAccording to Exhibit M-2:\n\"a mark of the increased importance of the DSS was its elevation to the rank of ministry. A new area of concern was the spread of international terrorism and the DSS was charged with the activity of preventing, detecting, neutralising and liquidating terrorist actions on Romania's territory. The specific task of combating terrorists was given to special anti-terrorist unit known by its acronym of USLA. (...) In significant addition to the combating of terrorism, the DSS embraced the propagation of personality cult of Ceausescu and the silencing of the regime's critics abroad.\"\nWhen asked about this evidence, the claimant said that the opposition leader, who had spent many years in prison, would not have allowed the claimant to work with him if he had been sure that the claimant had belonged to a repressive organization.\nThe panel rejects that answer and finds that the simple fact that the claimant belonged to the USLA is enough to exclude him. Moreover, the USLA, which kept under surveillance Arab students who were members of suspected terrorist organizations such as the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), sometimes used these people to commit crimes against Romanian exiles. Exhibit M-2 gives damning details about an operation carried out by Securitate to kill Monica Lovinescu, a Romanian literary critic exiled in France. Three members of the PLO were recruited to kill her.\nThe panel finds that the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act cannot be relied on to protect someone who knowingly worked for an institution dedicated to persecution and crimes against humanity.\nDECISION\nFor the above reasons, the panel determines that the claimant is excluded under articles 1F(a) and 1F(c) and therefore cannot be a refugee or person in need of protection.\nJos\u00e9 wa Tshisungu Tshisungu\nJos\u00e9 wa Tshisungu Tshisungu\nDecember 4, 2003\nDate\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - POLITICAL OPINION - EXCLUSION - ARTICLES 1F(a) AND (c) - NEGATIVE - ROMANIA\nNo. dossier SPR \/ RPD file #: MA0-07137\n5\n",

He is a member of the XXXXX tribe and is a Christian. The claimant's parents are both deceased. The claimant indicates, at line 4 at question 15 of his PIF, that he has 28 half-brothers and sisters. He did not give details on these siblings. The claimant has five years of formal education. From 1979 to 1995, he worked in farming on the family land in XXXXX. From 1995 until XXXXX 2000, he operated his own diamond and gold selling business.\nThe claimant bases his claim to \"Convention refugee\"1 status and refugee protection on his fear for his life under Section 97(1)b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.2 Specifically, as a diamond merchant, he was forced to sell diamonds and provide profits to the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels, who threatened to kill him if he did not co-operate.\nTHE HEARING\nEvidence adduced at the hearing included the claimant's Personal Information Form (PIF), as well as his oral testimony. In support of his claim, the claimant provided a birth certificate as a personal identity document, and two articles concerning country conditions in Sierra Leone.\nThe Refugee Protection Officer (RPO) provided background information on country conditions in Sierra Leone. The RPO also deposited personal information about the claimant, provided by Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC), in relation to the claimant's application for refugee protection.\nOn December 3rd, 2002, the RPO informed the Minister in a letter with respect to Article 23(1) of the Rules of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), stating that given the content of the claimant's PIF narrative, indicating his contact with the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels in Sierra Leone, Section 1F of the Refugee Convention would be considered at the hearing. On December 24th, Me Claude L\u00e9veill\u00e9e, Minister's representative, sent a Notice of Intervention to the Board and a request to postpone the hearing. The Minister based his intention to intervene in the file on the contents of the form, which he interpreted as saying that the claimant declared having been a member of the RUF. The Minister's representative indicated that he was not able to attend the hearing, and thus was asking for a postponement.\nPrior to a ruling by the panel on the request for postponement, counsel for the claimant faxed a letter to the Board on December 30th, objecting to the Minister's requested postponement. Counsel also sought clarification as to the Minister's source for the statement that the claimant was a member of the RUF. According to the original statement included with the Minister's Notice of Intervention, at point 2, the Minister stated his sources being the PIF of the claimant, declaring that he was a member of the RUF. In response to counsel's objection and request for clarification, the Minister sent a second mailing on January 2nd, 2003, in which the Minister acknowledged that in the PIF narrative, the claimant did not mention literally that he was a member of the RUF, and that counsel was correct in stating that.\nSince the Minister was basing his intervention and request for postponement on existing information that had been in possession of the Minister since February 2001, the request for a further delay was rejected. The panel indicated that the contents of the claimant's PIF, including his contacts with the RUF, were to be covered at the hearing.\nThe hearing was conducted in English without the services of an interpreter, as per the wishes of the claimant. Testimony was heard in a half-day, and oral observations and submissions were provided at the end of testimony.\nFACTS IN ISSUE\nIn his PIF narrative, the claimant wrote the following information. His narrative is reproduced here:\n\"My name is XXXXXXXX, I come from XXXXX in XXXXX district of the XXXXX Sierra Leone.\nI was a dealer in gold and diamonds. In XXXXX 1998, I was identified by a rebel of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) who knew that I dealt in this business and I was captured by them and was forced to sign an undertaking to sell the gems for them. They used the profits to buy ammunition. I had to sign or lose my leg, hand or be killed.\nIn April 2000 [amended at hearing to read \"July\"], when the UN resolution came into effect and the government started issuing certificates I was unable to meet their demands and they threatened me that if I did not sell more I would lose my life because I had already signed the agreement.\nI started having problems in September 2000, because of the embargo imposed on the selling of diamonds and gold by individuals as a means to prevent rebels from selling gems to buy weapons. These stones which they described as blood diamonds, because of the atrocities carried out against civilians as a strategy to terrorize people in the rebel's quest for the diamonds and also the government's new measures by giving dealer certificate to anybody who have been selling gems as a way of controlling the rebel agent from selling and buying ammunition.\nI wanted to get out of the agreement without losing my life. Business was very slow because of the embargo and the RUF was pressuring and threatening to sell the gems which beame (sic) more and more difficult. In XXXXX 2000, I discussed with one of my customers that used to buy a lot and he agreed to help me in exchange of gold or diamonds.\nThe rebels continued bringing me gems and gold and I agreed to sell that for them as I used to. But I gave them to my customer Mr XXXX and he agreed to bring document that will enable me to escape from my country.\nOn the XXXXX, 2000, I left my house to meet Mr XXXX and we were able to leave the country and finally reached Canada.\nI am asking the government of Canada to help me because I cannot go back to my country and for the fact that I was working for the rebels and have betrayed my agreement with them in order to save my life.\"\nAt question 31 of his PIF, the claimant indicates that he left Sierra Leone by car on XXXXX, 2000, and went to Guinea. On XXXXX, he left Guinea, and travelling through Belgium and the United States, arrived in Montreal by bus on December 10th, 2000. He claimed refugee status and requested refugee protection at CIC Montreal on December 10th.\nDETERMINATION\nAfter reviewing all of the evidence adduced, I find that there are serious reasons to believe that the claimant was complicit in acts described in Article 1Fa) of the Convention, and should therefore be excluded from refugee protection consideration. I am aware that statements given under oath or solemn declaration are considered true, unless there is good reason to doubt the veracity of the statements. My analysis follows.\nANALYSIS\nThe claimant alleges that he was born in XXXXX, Sierra Leone, on XXXXX, 1966. In support of his claim, the claimant deposited a certificate of birth as Exhibit P-2. Questions were raised about the content of the document. Specifically, in the upper right-hand corner, the improper spelling of the name of the ministry, where it indicates the Ministry Health and Sanitaion. The claimant stated that the name of the ministry, as he understood, was Health and Sanitation, but the \"t\" was missing from this copy.\nIt was pointed out to the claimant that at the bottom centre of the document, the word \"centre\" in the case \"Registration Centre\" had been altered. The claimant testified that he had not altered the document, and could not explain the apparent alteration to that word. The RPO pointed out that the lines, particularly in the bottom quarter of the document, appeared to be angled down from left to right. The RPO also pointed out that the title in the stamp at the bottom left of the document appeared to be inconsistent when it states that the name of the office is the \"Registrar births and death\"; \"births\" being plural and \"death\" being singular. Neither of the two stamps on the document are of clear quality.\nThe claimant could not offer any explanation for the concerns raised about the document. He did however provide an envelope in which he said the document was received, which corroborated his testimony that it had been sent to him from Sierra Leone. He testified that it had been sent by a friend of his father, with whom he had left it along with other identity documents which had not since been sent. The claimant testified that he had applied for the document in August 2000, when the government of Sierra Leone imposed new restrictions on the sale of diamonds, and a birth certificate was required to apply for a diamond seller certificate. While I am left with doubts about the quality of the document, on the balance of probabilities, I accept the claimant's testimony that this is in fact his birth certificate.\nThe claimant was questioned about his knowledge of Sierra Leone, and I found his answers to demonstrate a limited knowledge. When asked to describe the flag of Sierra Leone, he said it was green, white, and blue. He was asked to draw it out. When he did so, he drew three vertical lines, indicating the colour green was on the left-hand side, white in the middle, and blue on the right-hand side. It was pointed out to the claimant that the documentary evidence in Exhibit A-3,3 on the first page, indicates that the national flag of Sierra Leone has three equal horizontal, rather than vertical, stripes of green, white, and blue, from top to bottom. His inability to correctly identify the design of his national flag raised questions about his credibility.\nThe claimant stated that XXXXX was in the XXXX province of Sierra Leone. When asked what the population of his town was, he was only able to say that it was somewhere between 2,000 and 10,000 people. He was able to say that the countries bordering Sierra Leone were Liberia on the southern part and Guinea on the east and north. This was consistent with the documentary evidence. The panel took into consideration that the claimant had indicated, at question 17 of his PIF, that he had five years of formal education.\nThe claimant was asked what attempts he had made to obtain additional corroborative evidence to establish his identity. He testified that he had made efforts to contact the person with whom he had left his driver's licence and another identity document, but had been unable to do so. He testified that he had no contact with any of his 28 siblings. I found his testimony about his efforts to contact his father's friend, Mr. XXXXX, who had helped him flee the country, to be at best exaggerated. He initially stated that he called him everyday. When asked for more details about how often he had called, he said every evening, and then said almost every day since March 2002, he would call Sierra Leone.\nOn the balance of probabilities and based on the claimant's uncontradicted testimony, I accept that he is a citizen of Sierra Leone.\nThe claimant alleged that he was in the diamond and gold selling business from 1995 until 2000, when he left his country. He was asked questions to establish his level of knowledge about diamonds. He testified that clarity was important in establishing the value of a diamond. He also mentioned that colour could also affect the value. He cited that rough diamonds had several colours, including coffee, black-grey, and yellow. He said that the more clear the diamond is, the more valuable it is. He also said that by looking through a lens for cracks, you could also determine the value of a diamond. He made reference to the importance of the number of points in a carrot. When asked to name major diamond exporters in his country, he named one company, and said that he did not deal with major exporters, because they were mostly in Freetown and he had his individual customers in XXXXXX. I found no important contradictions in the claimant's testimony about his knowledge of the diamond business. Therefore, on the balance of probabilities, I accept that the claimant was involved in the buying and selling of diamonds in Sierra Leone, as he indicated.\nThe claimant was asked to testify about his job as a diamond trader. He said that he used to do farming on a family land, and in 1991, RUF attacked and took control of most of the country. He said after the death of his mother, in 1995, he got into the diamond business.\nThe claimant was then asked to describe his contact with the RUF. He testified that they broke into his house in XXXXX 1998. They told him they had come to take him to sell diamonds for them. When he originally resisted, they threatened to cut and kill him. He testified that they tied him up and took him to their base. He said they beat him and burned his arm. At this point, the claimant undid the sleeve of his shirt and displayed a visible mark on his arm. He did not provide a medical assessment of the scaring. However, there was discoloration over a large part of his arm. He then said they forced him to sign a document agreeing to sell diamonds for them. The claimant testified that he sold diamonds for RUF from XXXXX 1998 until he left his country.\nWhen he was asked to describe what he did, the claimant said that the rebels would bring him diamonds, and they would go with him to the man he sold them to. He then said that they would take the money for the sale of the diamonds. He said at this point that they came to his house. When asked how often they came, he then said that they told him that he should report to them everyday. Again, when asked for more clarification, he said that he should report to them every morning. He then repeated that they would also bring diamonds to his house.\nThe claimant was asked to describe a typical day in his dealings with the RUF. The question was asked four times before he said that they would bring him diamonds, and on each day they would beat him. He added that he was under hell. He was asked if there was anything else he wanted to say to describe a typical day. He said under severe punishment, they threatened to kill him, and they would take him to where they were washing the diamonds. He said that sometimes they would keep him there, and sparingly, they would allow him to go back to his home. He testified that he would sell two or three times per week for them. He was then asked how often he would be allowed to go home. He answered that usually on the weekends, they would allow him to go home. I found his testimony on describing a typical day to be hesitant and evasive.\nThe claimant was asked what he knew about the RUF prior to XXXXX 1998. He said that he knew that they were rebels who were attacking the government, and that they were killing people unnecessarily. He added that they attacked people at roadblocks, and would attack and arrest people like doctors and nurses. He added that he was aware that they would rape women and that they would kill people. He also said that he was aware that they would cut off the hands and legs of civilians. When asked if he knew why they would do these things, he replied that it was sheer wickedness.\nThe claimant was asked when he first heard about RUF. He said in 1991.\nThe claimant was asked what made him stop selling diamonds in XXXXX 2000. He said in October 2000, when the United Nations law on selling restrictions came into effect, imposing strict controls on the sale of diamonds, people were not interested anymore in buying from him. He said he told his customers that the RUF would kill him. He said in XXXXX, he went to a customer, Mr. XXXXX, who refused to buy. He said he begged the customer, and said that RUF would kill him if he could not sell the diamonds. The customer then said he would help if the claimant agreed to give him a diamond. In the meantime, the rebels kept bringing the claimant diamonds to sell. He said that in December, the RUF gave him a diamond to take home to prepare. He used this diamond as payment.\nThe claimant was asked if he had ever talked to Mr. XXXXX before about his problems. He said he talked to him in XXXXX 2000, and had not spoken to him before. He was asked if he had talked to anyone else prior to XXXXX 2000. He said no, he did not have the opportunity. He was asked why he did not have the opportunity prior to XXXXX 2000. He said that they did not give him a chance to move away. The claimant again was asked why he had waited until XXXXX 2000 to talk to Mr. XXXXX, since he testified he had been selling to Mr. XXXXX from 1995. He said that that is when the situation started getting worse for him. When asked to explain, he said that they were beating him. He testified he had been selling to XXXXX once every two weeks.\nWhen the claimant was asked, knowing what he knew, why he had waited two years to attempt to leave, he said that he did not have an opportunity earlier. When asked what was different at that time, he said only that the rebels wanted money from him and that they had threatened to kill him. Again, he was asked to explain how that was different from what he had described when they first approached him. He said they would beat him everyday. Again, I did not consider the claimant's explanation as to what was different and why he could not have taken the time earlier to escape from his situation. He had earlier testified that he would be allowed to go home on weekends. The claimant's testimony indicated that what was different as of XXXXX 2000 was that with the new restrictions on the sale of diamonds, people were refusing to buy from him. I am not satisfied that the claimant's testimony explained why he could not have made efforts earlier to escape.\nThe claimant was asked, towards the end of his testimony, what he feared today. He said he feared death from the rebels. He added that he believed that the rebels were still involved in silent killings. The RPO stated that there was documentary evidence that said that the rebels had been disarmed in the XXXXX area. The claimant again said that he feared that they would find him, and that he could not even go to Freetown, since the rebels are everywhere. He then added that he was aware that the rebel leader in the XXXX ordered him to be killed. He identified the leader as a XXXXX XXXXX. He was asked why he had not included this information in his PIF. He said that his first lawyer had said that he could explain it at the hearing. I did not consider this to be credible testimony. I find it implausible that if the claimant knew that there was a specific death order issued against him by the individual he named, he would not have considered this important enough to put in his PIF narrative.\nThe claimant did not say, when asked about his fear, that he feared the authorities in his country. It was only after, when he was specifically asked if he had any trouble with the authorities, that he replied yes, that because he sold diamonds to RUF, the authorities would arrest him. In his PIF, at question 20, when he was asked if he was or is wanted by police or military in any country, he replied no.\nAlthough I have my doubts about some of the claimant's testimony, I find that he testified without major contradictions. On the balance of probabilities, the claimant has established himself as someone who had business dealings with the RUF, albeit by force. His statements against interest are acceptable as credible testimony.\nTHE REASONS FOR EXCLUSION\nArticle 1F of the 1951 Convention reads as follows:\n\"The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:\n(a) he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes;\n(b) he has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission that country as a refugee;\n(c) he has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\"\nThe issue of complicity has been defined in jurisprudence as describing a situation where a claimant has not, in a \"physical sense\", committed a crime, but has aided, instigated, or counselled a perpetrator in the commission of a war crime or crime against humanity, he or she may, as an accomplice, be held responsible for the crime, and thus subject to being excluded from the refugee definition. An accomplice is as culpable as the principal perpetrator.4 Exclusion is based on personal and knowing participation in international crimes.5\nThe claimant indicated that the actions he had taken between XXXXX 1998 and XXXXX 2000, when he left his country, were all done under duress. Ramirez6 cites the following criteria with regards to duress:\n1. imminent threat of physical peril;\n2. the claimant is not responsible for the situation in which he finds himself;\n3. the harm inflicted must not be more severe than the threat he himself faced.\nThe claimant believed that he was in danger of imminent harm if he refused to co-operate with the rebels. However, he testified that he was able to go home on most weekends. His PIF made no mention of being detained for extended periods of time. By his own admission, he worked for the RUF for approximately two and a half years.\nThe documentary evidence about the RUF is clear. In Exhibit A-5,7 we read, on page 2, the following:\n\"During the year, there were fewer reports of serious abuses by RUF rebels, who in the past had committed numerous violent acts, including killings, abductions, deliberate mutilations, and rape. Prior to the resumption of the DDR process in May, rebel forces raided refugee sites and extorted and stole food. The RUF forces continued the longstanding practice of using previously abducted villagers (including women and children) as forced laborers, child soldiers, and sex slaves. While more than 2,600 abducted children were released by the RUF, most of those let go were male. International aid groups believe that girls who were abducted by the RUF may remain as sex slaves. Rebel atrocities caused the internal displacement of hundreds of thousands of civilians over the past several years (...)\"\nSimilar reports are documented in Exhibit A-6.8 In one example, we read the following:\n\"In June and July, RUF combatants attacked several villages, including Porpon, in which they killed at least three children, hacked off the ear of one man, and abducted at least sixteen civilians. On July 19, RUF combatants attacked Henekuma village and massacred at least ten civilians. There were several reports of member of pro-government militias having been tortured and summarily executed by the RUF, including the October 2000 execution of ten militiamen in Kambis District, and the May 2001 execution of two militiamen in Kono. In July, RUF rebels cut off the ear and severed the Achilles tendons of a militiaman captured in Koinadugu District.\"\nIn Exhibit A-8,9 in the introductory paragraphs of the Amnesty International report, we read the following:\n\"Sierra Leone bears terrible scars, both physical and psychological, of a lengthy and brutal conflict, marked by some of the worst crimes under international law known in any armed conflict in any part of the world.\"\nOn page 26 of the report, under section 6, we read the following:\n\"RUF forces have been responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity throughout a conflict during which civilians have borne the brunt of the violence. Thousands of men, women and children have been deliberately and arbitrarily killed or had their hands, arms or other limbs brutally cut off. Rape and other forms of sexual violence against girls and women have been widespread and systematic. Most of the 10,000 children - both boys and girls - estimated to have been associated with fighting forces in Sierra Leone have been abducted by the RUF and more than half of those have been used as combatants.\"\nThe link between the sale of diamonds and the dealings in arms and ammunition is detailed in Exhibit A-18.10 It is clear from the documentary evidence that RUF financed its operations, including its human rights abuses, through the sale of diamonds.\nI find that RUF is guilty of crimes against humanity, as set out in the London Agreement of August 8, 1945, and Chapter of the International Military Tribunal, namely the systematic murder and enslavement of, and commission of grave inhuman acts against, the civilian population in Sierra Leone. In this case, the uncontradicted testimony of the claimant confirms that he sold diamonds for the RUF for almost two and a half years. The claimant's testimony confirms that he was aware of the atrocities being committed by the RUF since 1991.\nThe claimant's testimony indicated at a minimum that he was allowed to go home on most weekends, and that he had made no attempt to extricate himself from his predicament prior to XXXXX 2000. His testimony indicated that he took action at that time because no one was wanting to buy his diamonds, as a result of the United Nations sanctions, and that the pressure on him increased. The evidence establishes that the claimant did have the opportunity to leave. In fact, he eventually took that opportunity. He provided no credible proof that this opportunity was not available earlier.\nThe evidence shows that the claimant's sale of diamonds two to three times a week for the RUF, over a two-year period, would have resulted in significant profits to an organization which he knew were being used to purchase ammunition, according to his PIF narrative. I find the evidence shows that although he may not have willingly joined the organization, his lack of diligence in making any attempt to leave prior to XXXXX 2000 negates his defence of duress and indicates that he eventually, by the length of time he remained involved, became responsible for his own predicament. I do not find it plausible that he could not have attempted to leave prior to XXXXX 2000. Since, by his own testimony, the RUF was in control of the area at the time he left, as he testified, I do not find his use of this fact to explain why he could not have attempted to leave earlier to be credible. I reject the argument that he could not have left earlier because the area was controlled by the RUF. I find that his failure to take any action to leave for over two years makes him an accomplice in the crimes committed by RUF, financed by the profits generated by his actions.\nFor the above reasons, I conclude that Mr. XXXXXXXX is a person referred to in Section 1Fa) of the Refugee Convention, in that there are serious reasons to conclude that he is guilty of crimes against humanity, and is a person defined in the Convention as not being deserving of international protection. I therefore reject his claim to refugee protection.\nLawrence Lang\nLawrence Lang\nFebruary 4, 2003\nDate\n\/jcbo\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - EXCLUSION CLAUSES - ART. 1F(a) - CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY - ACCOMPLICES - DURESS - MALE - NEGATIVE - SIERRA LEONE\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C.

The claimant is a Christian and a member of the Kimbundu tribe. The claimant is married, and her husband's whereabouts are unknown. She has five children; three are currently in Angola and two daughters are in Montreal with her ex-husband. Her two daughters and her ex-husband have made separate refugee claims. The claimant has six years of formal education.\nThe claimant bases her claim to \"Convention refugee\" status and request for refugee protection on the grounds of imputed political opinion and her membership in a particular social group. Specifically, she fears persecution in Angola because of the suspected activities of her husband with the Union nationale pour l'ind\u00e9pendance totale de l'Angola (UNITA) rebel group in Angola.\nTHE HEARING\nThe claimant's initial request for refugee protection was heard in October and November 2001. At that time, testimony was heard in Lingala and French, and then a Portuguese interpreter was requested for the second date, to establish the claimant's ability to speak Portuguese. The member hearing the claimant at that time fell ill for an extended period of time, and after months, it was decided that the claim would be reassigned and heard de novo. The claim then was rescheduled to proceed on the 22nd of August 2002.\nWhile the claimant had initially proceeded in French with interpretation to Lingala, the interpreter assigned to the August 22nd hearing was fluent in Portuguese, as per the last request of the previous panel. Testimony was heard in Portuguese at that time for approximately an hour by this panel, and the claimant was able to establish her ability to understand and speak Portuguese. However, the claimant had originally stated that because of where in Angola she was from and the fact that she had studied in French in the Democratic Republic of Congo, she preferred to proceed from Lingala to French and vice-versa. The second date of the hearing was set for December 11th, and testimony was completed with a Lingala-French interpreter.\nEvidence adduced at the hearing included the claimant's Personal Information Form (PIF), as well as her oral testimony. In support of her claim, the claimant deposited personal identity and background documents, as well as an identity document of her current spouse. Although the file originally contained the PIFs of two of the claimant's daughters, those children were heard as part of the claim of their father, who is the ex-spouse of the claimant.\nThe Refugee Protection Officer (RPO) deposited the Country Binder Indexes, as well as background information on the human rights and political situation in Angola. The RPO also deposited personal information about the claimant, provided by Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC). In addition, the RPO deposited personal information in the form of the PIFs of the claimant's two daughters and her ex-spouse, who were being heard under a separate claim. The claimant's ex-spouse had consented, when contacted, to his PIF being used in the claim of family members. The PIFs were admitted, since they were considered to contain similar questions of fact and were found to be relevant. They had been part of the evidence in the first hearing. Finally, the transcripts of the claimant's first hearing were also deposited into evidence for this hearing.\nThe hearing was conducted initially in French with Portuguese interpretation on the first day, and with Lingala interpretation on the second day of the hearing. Testimony was completed over two half-days, and oral observations and submissions were made at the end of testimony.\nFACTS IN ISSUE\nIn her PIF, the claimant alleged the following information.\nThe claimant was born in Luanda and is part of the Kimbundu ethnic group, situated in the north of the country. The claimant has five children and she married her current husband in XXXXX 1995. Her husband, Mr. XXXXXXX, is a member of the Bakongo ethnic group, and he worked as an inspector with the \"XXXXX XXXX XXXX\". The claimant and her current husband belong to the ethnic groups commonly persecuted by the government of the day in Angola. They sympathized with the cause of the primary rebel opposition group, called UNITA.\nThe claimant was harassed by neighbours, and in XXXX 1999, during a dispute between children and their ethnic groups, the claimant was burned on her face by a neighbour. The claimant was identified with an ethnic group generally referred to as \"les Bakongo retornado\" (\"the returnees\").\nThe claimant's current husband decided to join the UNITA and to collaborate with them. He recruited new members for the organization. It was because of the activities of her husband that the claimant was forced to leave her country.\nIn XXXXX 1999, the claimant's husband received a notice to appear at the police station in XXXXX. He ignored the notice and decided not to go. On XXXXX, 1999, while the claimant was returning home from the market, she saw several police officers in front of her home, taking her husband away in handcuffs. The claimant hid at a neighbour's house. The neighbour went to inform herself about what was happening. Through the neighbour's efforts, the claimant learned that the police had searched her house and had found documents incriminating her husband and establishing their link with UNITA. The claimant's children had been able to escape and had gone to a sister of the claimant's. The police returned and searched the house again while the claimant was in hiding. At this point, the claimant decided to go to Cacuoco, where she stayed for approximately a year. During that time, she had no news of her family.\nAlso during that time, the claimant became friendly with a visiting clergyman, Father XXXX. The pastor agreed to help the claimant return to XXXX to search for her children. It was in XXXXX 2000 that the claimant returned to XXXXX and hid in the pastor's church. After approximately a month, the claimant learned that two of her children had gone to Canada to meet with their father. The claimant had no news about her three first children or about her current husband. One day in XXXXX, the claimant met the neighbour who had burned her face. Later in XXXXX, when coming back to the church with the pastor, they were surprised to see that police had gone to the church looking for her. The pastor as well had received a notice to appear at the police station. He learned that the neighbour the claimant had seen on the street had informed the police of her whereabouts.\nAt this point, the pastor made arrangements for the claimant to travel with him, and they left Angola on the XXXXX 2001. The claimant travelled through the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Italy, and the United States, before arriving in Canada at the Lacolle border crossing on January 9th, 2001. She requested refugee status at that time.\nThe claimant fears returning to Angola because of her suspected ties to UNITA and the government's mistreatment of anyone suspected of having collaborated with them.\nDETERMINATION\nAfter reviewing all of the evidence adduced, I am prepared to issue the benefit of the doubt on key elements of the claimant's testimony, and find in favour of the claimant. I am aware that statements given under oath or solemn declaration are considered true, unless there is good reason to doubt the veracity of the statements.\nAlthough I have some doubts about the claimant's identity documents, I find it is insufficient to find, on the balance of probabilities, that the claimant is not who she alleges to be. My analysis follows.\nANALYSIS\nWith regard to the claimant's identity, I would make the following points.\nAt the outset of the hearing, the claimant amended her PIF narrative to correct the spelling of her family name, from \"XXXXX\" to add the letter XX and state her name as \"XXXXX\".\nIn Exhibit P-2, the claimant's \"carnet personnel\", we see her name written as \"XXXXXXX\". In Exhibit P-3, her national identity card, the claimant's name is listed as \"XXXXXX\". In Exhibit P-5, the marriage registration certificate, we see the claimant's name listed as \"XXXXXX\". The claimant said her first husband's name was XXXXX XXXX XXXX, with the XX, and although she was married a second time in 1995 to XXXXXXXX, when she amended her PIF, she corrected the spelling to include the XXX, which would be consistent with the name of her first husband, and not consistent with what is in Exhibit P-3. Although at the hearing, questions were asked about the claimant's maiden name and her current name, I am left with doubts about why there are inconsistencies. However, although I have these doubts, they are not sufficient, on the balance of probabilities, to negate the claimant's identity as a citizen of Angola. Since spelling mistakes are not uncommon in identity documents from Africa, I gave the claimant the benefit of the doubt on her identity.\nThe claimant testified that she grew up in the northern area of Angola, on the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and went to school for six years in the DRC, studying in French. On the first day of this de novo hearing, the claimant testified for an hour in Portuguese, and established her ability both to understand and speak the language of Angola. The claimant testified that she spent 26 years of her life, from the year of her birth, in the DRC with her parents, renewing their status on a yearly basis. She testified that this is why she was more comfortable speaking Lingala and French and why she only learned Portuguese as an adult, after moving back to her country of birth. When testifying about locations of communities and places in Angola, the claimant did so without hesitation, and demonstrated a general knowledge of the geography of the country.\nFor these reasons, I find, on the balance of probabilities, that the documents presented in support of the claimant's testimony remain uncontradicted, and that the claimant has established, on the balance of probabilities, that she is a citizen of Angola.\nConcerning the claimant's testimony, I found it to be generally consistent with the testimony provided at her first hearing, as indicated in the transcripts submitted into evidence. I also found the central elements of her story to be essentially consistent with what she had said at the Port of Entry (POE) to Canada when she arrived, in January 2001. The claimant's ability to consistently testify about the events she alleged occurred to her in Angola enhanced the credibility of the claim. At the POE, the claimant wrote a statement in French, included with the POE notes, which indicated that her current husband was also a collaborator of UNITA. The central elements of her narrative at that time were consistent with the contents of her PIF.\nThe claimant has established, with a marriage certificate which remains uncontradicted, that she was indeed married to XXXXXXXXX. Since sworn testimony is considered true, and the claimant did not contradict herself on the elements of her current husband's involvement with UNITA, I find, on the balance of probabilities, that the claimant has established her husband's links to UNITA.\nThe objective documentary evidence for the time periods in 1999 and 2000, when the claimant's husband and herself encountered difficulties with the Angolan government, is consistent with what the claimant alleged happened to her and her husband, and establishes her story as plausible. With no evidence to the contrary, I find the claimant has established the key elements of her allegations, on the balance of probabilities.\nHaving accepted the key elements of her story on the balance of probabilities, and thus accepting that the claimant is sought by the police as a collaborator with UNITA, I did not see Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) as a viable option in this claim.\nConcerning the peace accord signed at the beginning of 2002, I find that given the history of failed peace accords in Angola over the 26 years of the civil conflict, the current timeframe has not yet established that peace will in fact be durable and sustainable and that I can conclude that there has been a change of circumstances. There are indications in the documentary evidence that attempts are being made to integrate former UNITA members into mainstream Angolan society. However, I am not satisfied that the evidence yet indicates that someone who was sought as a collaborator of UNITA would not have a well-founded fear of persecution.\nGiven these findings, I believe the risk still exists, at a level superior to that of a mere possibility.\nTherefore, after reviewing all of the evidence adduced, I find that the claimant has met her burden to establish that she has a well-founded fear of persecution on the grounds of imputed political opinion and her membership in a particular social group, as the wife of a suspected UNITA member.\nThe objective documentary evidence in the US Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 2001,1 indicates, in the section entitled Disappearance, that persons taken into police custody often disappeared without a trace. It also indicates that suspects accused of illegal weapons ownership or collaboration with UNITA often disappeared. Although this situation may have changed since the peace accord was signed in early 2002, there is little evidence available to the tribunal at this point to allow the panel to conclude that the risk in fact is not more than a mere possibility.\nThe record of security forces for the abuse of detainees includes arbitrary arrests and lengthy pre-trial detention, extrajudicial killings, torture, beatings, and rape.

XXXXXXXXXXXX), a citizen of Pakistan. He alleges a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of his political opinions.\nThe evidence presented at the hearing by the claimant, his counsel and the refugee protection officer (RPO) consisted of the claimant's testimony, legal documents, some personal documents, and documents regarding the socio-political situation in Pakistan.\nThe written and oral testimony alleged the following.\nThe claimant joined the student wing of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) in 1983 embarking on a political road, which would see him working for the party during election campaigns and participating in various political activities.\nPolice targeted the claimant in 1996, while participating at a gathering.\nThe claimant, while participating in the 1997 election campaign, was attacked by members of the MQM who beat him. He sought the help of police but it was to no avail.\nOn XXXXX, 1997, police raided the claimant's home but he was absent.\nOn XXXX, 1998, the claimant participated in a hunger strike.\nIn XXXXX 1999, the claimant was arrested while participating in a political march. He was released following the payment of a bribe.\nOn XXXX, 2001, police raided the claimant's home following a political gathering held at his home. The claimant was absent and, upon learning of the raid decided to go into hiding. The claimant was informed that the police had registered a case against him. At this point, the claimant decided to leave Pakistan bound for Canada where he made a claim for \"Convention refugee\" status.\nHaving analysed all the evidence both oral and written, the panel finds that the claimant is neither a \"Convention refugee\"1 nor a \"person in need of protection\"2 for the following reasons.\nCore to the credibility of the claim at bar is the issue of identity. Article 106 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (Act) states the following:\n\"The Refugee Protection Division must take into account, with respect to the credibility of a claimant, whether the claimant possesses acceptable documentation establishing identity, and if not, whether they have provided a reasonable explanation for the lack of documentation or have taken reasonable steps to obtain the documentation\".\nThe evidence in the present claim showed that the claimant entered Canada using a British passport under the name of XXXXXXXXXX, date of birth (DOB) XXXXX, 1968. In the interview with the Canadian Immigration authorities, the claimant claimed refugee status under the name XXXXXXXXXXXX, DOB XXXXX, 1970. The claimant then filed a Personal Information Form (PIF) under the name XXXXXXXXXXXX, DOB XXXXX, 1967. The claimant testified that the latter is his true name and date of birth.\nThe claimant was questioned extensively regarding his identity. He stated that he was fearful and that the agent instructed him to use a different name. The evidence showed that indeed the first identity found in the British passport was a false one. The passport had been altered to substitute the original picture for the claimant's. The evidence also showed that the claimant upon arrival misled the authorities in Canada by giving them the name of XXXXXXXXXXXX. Asked to explain, the claimant testified that he was following his agent's instructions. The panel finds this difficult to believe. The claimant was confronted by the Immigration officer as to the authenticity of the British passport upon arrival in Canada; instead of being honest and forthright, he decided to give another name as his. The behaviour of the claimant and his lack of honesty with respect to the interview with the Immigration officer and his name is strange and robs him of his credibility. The claimant is a well-educated person having studied law in Pakistan; the panel feels that there is no reasonable explanation for the claimant misleading the authorities upon his arrival in Canada.\nThe claimant was asked when he decided to inform the authorities about his real name. He responded that he was feeling bad and that after meeting a consultant, he was informed to change his name. With respect to this last name XXXXXXXXXXXX, the evidence showed that the claimant only obtained a duplicated of the National Identity Card (NIC) approximately two months before his refugee hearing. Asked to explain, he stated that his family could not find the original and as such, he obtained a duplicate computerised card. The documentary evidence3 shows that the new computerised NICs are deliverable to a person's home but if a person wanted to obtain a duplicate of the old NIC, it is delivered to the applicant in person in the cases of male applicants. In the claim at bar, the claimant had left his country and was in Canada when the duplicate was obtained leading the panel to question how the card was obtained.\nThe claimant also produced a birth certificate and school certificates under the name of XXXXXXXXXXXX. The documentary evidence shows that false or forged documents are easily obtained upon payment of money. The panel has no reason to doubt the documentary evidence and as such, concludes that the claimant did not meet his burden of proof of clearly establishing his identity.\nIn the claim at bar, the claimant also produced, at the second sitting, a photocopy of four pages of a Pakistani passport showing his picture and under the name of XXXXXXXXXXXX. The panel does not give any probative value to this document. It is a photocopy and not an original and as such the panel has no means to verify the physical nature of the document. In addition it only contains four pages and is incomplete and as such, does not allow the panel the opportunity to verify the whole document.\nAs the panel does not believe that the claimant has met his burden with respect to identity, it does not find the claimant credible and as a result, does not believe his story of alleged persecution in Pakistan.\nFor all the above-mentioned reasons, the panel determines that the claimant, Mr. XXXXXXXXXXXX (a.k.a. XXXXXXXXXXXX), is neither a \"Convention refugee\" as defined in section 96 of the Act nor a \"person in need of protection\" as defined in section 97(1) of the Act.\nTony Manglaviti\nMe Tony Manglaviti\nFebruary 21st, 2003\nDate\n\/ez\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - POLITICAL OPINION - CREDIBILITY - IDENTITY - MALE - NEGATIVE - PAKISTAN\n1 \" 96.

She claims to be a \"person in need of protection\" and a \"Convention refugee\".\nThe claimant alleges that she is a citizen of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and that she was born there on XXXXX, 1982.\nThe evidence submitted in this case consists of the claimant's testimony, her Personal Information Form (PIF) and personal documents, as well as documents on the socio-political situation in the DRC.\nIdentity\nBefore considering the merits of the claim for refugee protection, a determination must be made regarding the claimant's obligation to establish her identity and her citizenship with respect to the country against which her claim is made.\nIn this case, the claimant is making her claim against the DRC, the authorities of which (both the security forces and those organizing and supporting the rebellion) she said she fears.\nIn making a ruling on the claimant's evidence on identity and citizenship, the panel finds that she has failed to discharge the burden of proof that rests on her by demonstrating, on a preponderance of evidence, that she is the person she says she is and that she is a citizen of the DRC.\nRule 7 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules, which is headed \"Documents Establishing Identity and Other Elements of the Claim\", provides that\nThe claimant must provide acceptable documents establishing identity and other elements of the claim. A claimant who does not provide acceptable documents must explain why they were not provided and what steps were taken to obtain them.\nThis rule imposes an obligation on all refugee protection claimants to produce acceptable documents to establish their identity, unless a good reason is submitted to justify the absence of acceptable documents.\nRule 7 should be read in conjunction with section 106 of the Act, which is headed \"Claimant Without Identification\" and provides:\n\"The Refugee Protection Division must take into account, with respect to the credibility of a claimant, whether the claimant possesses acceptable documentation establishing identity, and if not, whether they have provided a reasonable explanation for the lack of documentation or have taken reasonable steps to obtain the documentation.\"\nThe claimant submitted two documents in evidence to establish her identity and her Congolese citizenship. One was a birth certificate issued at Goma on XXXXX, 1997, and the other was a baptism book from the diocese of Goma.3 Neither of these documents intended to corroborate the claimant's testimony with respect to her identity and her citizenship served this purpose. It is appropriate to find that a baptism book does not establish an individual's citizenship. Such a document records a sacrament that was administered to its holder along with that person's religious denomination. It clearly is not an identification document. Furthermore, it contains no photo that would indicate whether the document belongs to the claimant. Possession of such a document does not in any way constitute evidence that its holder is a citizen of a particular country.\nAs for the other document, the birth certificate, if it could be used to establish an individual's citizenship, it would not serve this purpose for the claimant because it lacks probative value. Not only is it not validated by a revenue stamp, which, based on our specialized knowledge, is used in the DRC, as evidenced by the sample appearing in Appendix 8 of Exhibit A-2. Whatever the province of origin in the DRC, a birth certificate bears a revenue stamp with a water seal superimposed on the stamp.4\nMost damaging of all to the claimant's case, the information appearing on the birth certificate she produced in evidence indicates that it was taken from the citizenship identification card of the person concerned. However, this could not have been true or possible, because on XXXXX, 1997, the date on which the card was issued, the claimant was not of the age of majority and was not eligible for a citizenship identification card, as the claimant has furthermore confirmed. She has never had a national identification card.\nThe claimant did not submit any other evidence to corroborate her identity or her citizenship. As a final argument, she submitted that she speaks Swahili and that she is familiar with the region from which she says she comes.\nWith all respect, the area in question is a border region and the populations of a number of nations that share their borders with those of that region of the DRC also speak Swahili, which, in the circumstances, would not reassure the panel of the claimant's identity or citizenship.\nThe panel is furthermore aware of the unexplained presence of documents bearing the claimant's photo and which if they proved to have probative value would establish the claimant's identity and citizenship as being that of a national of Sierra Leone. Documents seized upon her arrival included an identification card issued to the claimant by the Red Cross and an identification card issued to the claimant by the Republic of Sierra Leone, both of which would suggest her name is not the one she alleged but rather \"XXXXX\" The presence of these two documents raises a real issue as to the stated identity and citizenship of the claimant, who has not made a claim against Sierra Leone.\nWhen asked to enter into evidence the false Kenyan passport and the airline tickets and boarding cards she used to travel to Canada, the claimant said it was impossible to do so because she had handed these documents over to the smuggler who had allegedly accompanied her to Canada.\nIt goes without saying that by acting in this manner, that is, by depriving the panel of material evidence relevant for purposes of assessing her credibility and her subjective fear, indeed her identity and citizenship, the claimant has considerably reduced the parameters on the panel's analysis of the evidence, which is not without without consequences for her credibility. In this regard, the following words of Nadon J. are instructive:\n\"[. . .] There can be no doubt, as Reed J. stated, that the passport \"would have provided some objective evidence of her travels through the various countries which she asserts took place\". It goes without saying that the forged passport in the case at bar and the air ticket could have provided credible evidence of the plaintiff's identity and his journey to come to Canada. [. . .]\n[. . .] I take this opportunity to add that it is entirely reasonable for the Refugee Division to attach great importance to a claimant's passport and his air ticket. In my opinion, these documents are essential to establish the claimant's identity and his journey to come to Canada. Unless it can be assumed that a refugee status claimant is actually a refugee, it seems unreasonable to me to ignore the loss of these documents without a valid explanation. In my view, it is too easy for a claimant to simply state that he has lost these documents or the facilitator has taken them. If the Refugee Division insists on these documents being produced, the facilitators may have to change their methods. [. . .]\n[...] Minimizing the importance of the passport and air ticket as documents to be produced or ignoring their non-submission for all sorts of reasons in my opinion only serves to encourage all those whose only purpose is to take advantage of a system which is intended solely to enable genuine refugees to come to Canada. [...]\"5\nThis should be considered in conjunction with a note from the immigration officer in his comments on the port-of-entry notes signed by the claimant on September 14, 2001, at the Montreal Airport, which indicates as follows:\n[TRANSLATION]\nUnwilling to cooperate in providing information. Subject says she travelled with someone who helped her get into the country.\nImmigration officer at disembarkation said she travelled with a Cameroonian passport on flight XXXXX. No other supporting evidence. Previously applied for refugee protection in Kenya, which was not granted. Upon her arrival, subject had a refugee card in her possession issued by the Sierra Leone Red Cross in the name of XXXXX. Subject has been living in Kenya since XXXXX 2001, but only gave her permanent address in the Congo.\" (Emphasis by the undersigned).\nThis note from the immigration officer and the person who interviewed the claimant upon her arrival in Canada establishes her evanescent credibility. The panel notes that the claimant, whose credibility in relation to evidence of her identity and citizenship has already been weakened, particularly as she allegedly travelled with a false document from the Cameroon that she cannot submit in evidence, apparently lived for a lengthy seven-month period (from XXXXX, 2001 to XXXXX, 2001) in Kenya. The reasons she gave for failing to obtain refugee status there was that whenever she appeared at the reception area of the High Commissioner for Refugees (HCR), she was sent away without any reason being given. The panel does not accept what she said as it finds it not to be credible. The claimant has provided no explanation of why the HCR would have refused to give her the proper opportunity to complete a claim for refugee status. The statement to the effect that she could have obtained such status in Kenya, as indicated by the immigration officer, strengthens the panel's opinion that the claimant lacks credibility when she says that she was sent away and, for this reason, failed to obtain such status in Kenya.\nIn short, neither the claimant's identity nor her Congolese citizenship has been established by means of reliable documents or any credible or trustworthy evidence, such as depositions from friends, family members, elders from her community or detailed affidavits from individuals with a personal knowledge of her identity and her Congolese citizenship. Quite to the contrary, the documentary evidence on the record creates further confusion and even the possibility that she is a citizen of the Republic of Sierra Leone.\nFollowing its analysis, the panel finds that the claimant has failed to prove on a preponderance of evidence that she is the person she claims to be and that she is a citizen of the DRC. Accordingly, there is no need for the panel to go on and analyze the merits of the fear alleged by the claimant, in view of the absence of any nexus in terms of the claimant's citizenship and the DRC, the country against which she made her claim.\nFor all of these reasons, the panel determines that the claimant is neither a \"Convention refugee\" nor a \"person in need of protection\" within the meaning of the Act.\nThe panel rejects the claim for refugee protection of XXXXX XXXXXX XXXXXXX.\nMartial Guay\nMe Martial Guay\nMay 23, 2003\nDate\n1 \"96.

Counsel for the claimant forwarded his submissions after the hearing.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant is 39 years old. She is married and is the mother of three young children, still living in Ethiopia. In her PIF, she alleges that she is of Oromo origin. She detains an engineering diploma and was a senior supervisor in the Ethiopian XXXXXX XXXXX XXXX. She was never a member of any political organization, but she has always sympathized with the plight of the Oromo people, and she was an ardent supporter of political associations and groups fighting for the rights of the Oromos.\nThe claimant alleges that during the last decade, she was \"repeatedly persecuted, tortured and imprisoned\" by the government of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). She was persecuted because of her Oromo origin and because she was suspected of being a member of the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF).\nThe claimant's problems started in June 1992, following the first district elections in Ethiopia. She was arrested on XXXXXXXX, 1992, during the countrywide clampdown on the OLF members and sympathizers, after the OLF left the government coalition and was banned by the EPRDF government. The claimant was detained for two weeks, beaten, and psychologically tortured. No charges were pressed against her, but she was warned by the police that she would be under their constant surveillance. The authorities continued to harass, threaten, and discriminate against her, both at work and in her neighbourhood.\nThe claimant was again arrested on XXXXX, 1998, during another police clampdown against the OLF. She was accused by the government of supporting Eritrea in its conflict with Ethiopia. The claimant was again detained for four weeks and mistreated. She was released, but her private and professional life continued to be scrutinized by the authorities. Her residence was raided a number of times and she was called for questioning. The claimant began seriously wondering whether she was able to continue living in such circumstances.\nIn XXXXXX 2000, the claimant was approached by some Oromo people now living in XXXXXXX, but who had their roots in Ginde-Beret, as the claimant did. They were planning to create an association of Ginde-Beret's children, with the objective of helping people in their area of origin. The claimant expressed her wish to become a member of the association and attended its founding meeting, which took place on XXXXX, 2000. However, the association was accused by the government of raising funds for illegal activities of the OLF. The claimant and some other members were arrested, two leaders of the association disappeared, and three others were able to escape the country. The claimant was arrested on XXXXX, 2002, and detained for almost two months. She was interrogated and beaten in order to make her admit that the association was a fundraising body of the OLF.\nAfter the claimant was released from detention, she decided to leave Ethiopia without delay. She obtained a letter of invitation from her sister-in-law living in Montreal and started preparing her trip. She obtained a Canadian visitor's visa, and was able to leave Ethiopia without awakening any suspicions from the security agents. She came to Canada in September 2001, and two days later, asked for Canada's protection.\nIf she returns to Ethiopia, the claimant is afraid that her life will be in danger at the hands of the government's security agents.\nDETERMINATION\nAfter examining the claimant's written and oral testimonies, as well as all the evidence adduced in this case, I have come to the conclusion that the claimant is not a \"Convention refugee\"1 nor a \"person in need of protection\",2 for the reasons which follow.\nANALYSIS\nThe hearing\nThe hearing in this case started on February 6, 2003. During this sitting, the Refugee Protection Officer (RPO) and the tribunal finished their questions to the claimant. Serious credibility issues were raised by the tribunal. There was no time to continue, and the hearing was adjourned for the counsel's questions. Counsel also indicated a medical expertise concerning the claimant's kidney problems would be provided, as well as an expertise of the translation of the dates on Exhibit P-5,3 from the Ethiopian to the Gregorian calendar.\nOn the same day, February 6, 2003, counsel for the claimant sent a letter to the tribunal, advising that during a lunch with the claimant, he had learned new facts from the claimant's life, which she was hiding from him and from the tribunal, facts which give coherence to her claim. Counsel wrote that he had learned that the claimant's father was a XXXX in Mengistu army and was killed on a battlefield. The claimant's sister was arrested in 1994. As per counsel's letter, the claimant was advised to hide her father's background, because Canada did not sympathize with the Mengistu regime. According to the letter, the claimant would bring additional documents from Ethiopia in support of these allegations.\nThe hearing resumed on March 27. The claimant did not submit the medical evaluation mentioned by her counsel at the end of the first session. Counsel also indicated that he did not contest any longer the translation of the dates on the police certificate (Exhibit P-5). The claimant submitted four documents concerning her father (Exhibits P-10 to P-13).\nHowever, after asking a few questions to the claimant, counsel indicated that he was unable to continue the hearing, due to the effects of medication which he was taking. The hearing was adjourned until the next day, March 28. Counsel and the tribunal asked the claimant the remaining questions. However, after starting his submissions, counsel was not prepared to indicate to the tribunal pertinent documentary evidence in support of the claimant's allegations. He again asked for a postponement, due to his incapability to continue working under the influence of the medication which he was taking. The tribunal allowed additional time for submissions, which were received on time.\nIdentity\nIn order to establish her identity, the claimant submitted her Ethiopian passport with a Canadian tourist visa, as well as several other identity documents. Since there is no reason to doubt the authenticity of these documents, I conclude that the claimant has established her identity. I also accept that she is from the Oromo ethnic group, as indicated in her Ethiopian identity card (Exhibit P-2).\nCredibility\nHowever, I have rejected the claimant's testimony as not credible, because of the serious contradictions and omissions that it contained.\nPolitical opinion\nThe claimant testified that she was arrested by the government security people for the first time in XXXXX 1992, because she was considered by the authorities as an OLF member. She explained that before the general elections in Ethiopia in June 1992, she had participated in three electoral public gatherings organized by the OLF. The meetings were legal, since at that time the OLF was still working together with the government. According to the claimant, about 6,000 people participated in such meetings.\nThe claimant believes that she was arrested in 1992 because she participated in these meetings. Asked how she could have been identified among some 6,000 people who participated in these gatherings, the claimant answered that she was identified because she is the only Oromo woman engineer, and therefore she is well known. Even if I can accept the claimant's testimony that she might be the only Oromo woman engineer, I still find it implausible that the claimant would have been targeted as a supporter of the OLF because she took part in legal pre-election mass meetings of the OLF, which at that time was still part of the government coalition.\nBut most of all, in her written narrative, the claimant did not mention that she was arrested in XXXXX 1992 because she had participated in three public meetings organized by the OLF. Asked to explain that important omission, the claimant declared that she had told her previous counsel about the meetings, but he just had not written it in her story. I do not accept this explanation as sufficient. Not only did the claimant confirm before the hearing that her story was correct, complete, and true, but also I find it implausible that an experienced refugee counsel, as was Me Buron, would have told the claimant not to write about the events which triggered her persecution. The claimant testified that she was arrested due to her participation in these meetings, not only in 1992, but also in 1998, when the police targeted people who, like herself, had already been arrested in the past.\nConsidering the above-mentioned implausibilities and the important omission, I reject the claimant's allegation that she was arrested and detained by the government security in 1992 and in 1998.\nThe claimant testified that she was arrested for the third time on XXXXX, 2000, in relation with her involvement in the creation of the social association of the Oromos from Ginde-Beret area. The claimant indicated that four other people involved in the association were also arrested. One person had disappeared and two managed to flee Ethiopia. She was asked to give their names, which she did. That testimony, however, contradicted her PIF, where she wrote that two people had disappeared and three had fled Ethiopia. Later on, the claimant was asked to repeat the names of the four people who had been arrested along with her. She was not able to do so. She was able to give one full name and one last name. After a long hesitation, she gave the first name of another person and said that she did not remember the other names. I find it implausible that the claimant would not have remembered the names of people whom she knew, with whom she had started an association, and who had been arrested along with her, particularly given that she had named these people earlier during the hearing. I believe that the claimant could not repeat the names because she invented them when she was first questioned on that subject.\nWhen the claimant was asked to show the tribunal the originals of her documents, she handed a small pile of documents, including one which was not produced prior to the hearing. That document (Exhibit P-9), a medical certificate from XXXXXXXXX Clinic, indicated that the claimant was \"Examined And \/ Or Treated On: From XXXX up to XXXXX 2000\", for \"Chronic Pylonephritis\". It indicates that:\n\"She was treated as in patient and out patient with strict control of Antibiotic and bed rest.\"\nWe also read, under Doctor's Recommendations & Sickleave, that she was:\n\"Given rest with medication from XXXXXXX 2000 up to XXXXX 2000.\"\nThe claimant was confronted with this document, which seems to indicate that she was treated in the clinic as an in and out patient for a chronic kidney problem at the same time when she was allegedly in jail for two months, starting at XXXXX. The claimant's explanations were confused and totally implausible. She testified that she was severely beaten by the security agents when she was arrested on XXXXXX, 2000, and at night of the same day, she was transported to the clinic from the detention centre. She was later again transported by the police from the prison to the clinic for further treatment. After she was released, she went to obtain the medical certificate because at her work (a government agency), she was reimbursed for a taxi she took to get to the clinic and for the treatment for which she had paid from her own pocket. All that simply does not make any sense.\nThe claimant also testified that before XXXXX, 2000, she had never suffered from kidneys problems. Confronted with the Exhibit P-9, which indicates that the claimant suffers a chronic kidney disease, she changed her testimony, stating that she had already had kidney problems in 1992, when she was first beaten by the police. I do not give any credence to the claimant's obviously improvised explanations.\nFinally, the claimant omitted in her PIF to mention that she was treated in the hospital in XXXXX 2000 due to the police mistreatment. I find it an important omission, and do not accept as plausible the claimant's explanation, that she omitted it on the advise of her first counsel.\nConsidering all the above, I do not believe that the claimant was arrested in XXXX 2000 for her involvement in an Oromo social association, and in general that she was persecuted in Ethiopia, as she alleges.\nSince I find the claimant's testimony not credible, I do not give any weight to the letters sent on the claimant's request and filed under Exhibits P-6, P-7 and P-8, as well as to the certificate issued by the XXXXXXXX City Government Federal Police Commission (Exhibit P-5). In any case, the letter sent originally by Mr. XXXXXXX (Exhibit P-6), in which he indicated that his \"most recent\" contribution to the \"Ginderberet Development Union\" was in XXXX 2000, contradicts the claimant's story that the organisation was created on XXXX, 2000. Only on counsel's direct requests, Mr. XXXXXXX adjusted his letter to the claimant's story in his subsequent correspondence (Exhibit P-8). As for the Exhibit P-5, it was issued on XXXXX, 2000, and it confirms that the claimant was detained from XXXXX to XXXXX, 2000. That document contradicts the claimant's PIF and her testimony. She testified that she went to obtain that document after she was released in order to justify her two-month absence at her work. However, the date of issue is XXXXX, when the claimant would have allegedly still been in prison, and the date of her arrest is indicated as XXXXX, and not XXXXX, as she declared.\nThe lack of credibility of the claimant's story is further reinforced by her behaviour, which is inconsistent with the alleged fear of persecution. The claimant had her passport since XXXXXX 2000. She could not reasonably explain why, having a valid passport, she waited for almost one year after being released from prison to leave her country.\nThe claimant also omitted to write in her PIF that she had to use bribes and her personal connections in order to obtain her Ethiopian passport and the Ethiopian exit visa. It is an important omission, which the claimant was not able to explain in a satisfactory manner.\nThe claimant alleges that she was wanted by the Ethiopian security. However, she left her country with her own passport, without any problems. I do not consider as satisfactory her explanation that she was not noticed by the security agents who stamped her passport, and was not stopped at the airport because she took a night flight and because it was raining.\nIn conclusion, I rejected the claimant's story of persecution as invented and devoid of all credibility. I do not believe that the claimant was persecuted in Ethiopia for reasons of her political opinion, nor that there is a serious possibility that she would be persecuted on that ground should she go back to her country.\nMembership in a particular social group (family)\nDuring the second session of the hearing, the claimant was asked why she had not exposed her father's past in her PIF and during the first session. The claimant answered that her first counsel (Me Buron) had told her to tell only her own story. However, answering further questions from her present counsel, the claimant testified that her father's high position during the Haile Selassie and Mengistu regimes, and her grandfather's prominence in the Oromo community, had crucial importance in the persecution which she subsequently suffered under the present government.\nIn the light of that answer, the claimant was asked again why, then, all these important facts were not mentioned in her PIF, since, according to her testimony, those facts had a direct impact on her situation. She could not give any reasonable answer.\nAt the beginning of the third sitting, counsel asked the claimant again the same question: why had not she written in her PIF that she was targeted because of her father's and grandfather's positions. Now the claimant remembered (what the counsel had already written in his letter from February 6) that she had not written about it because people in the community had advised her not to do so, since the Canadian government was not favourable towards the Mengistu regime, considered as communist. Being afraid to be refused, she followed these suggestions. The claimant could not reasonably explain why she had not given that reason when asked about it one day before.\nI do not give any credence to all these explanations. It is clear to me that the claimant was looking for other ways to save her case, after serious credibility problems had appeared during the first sitting. I do believe that the claimant's father was a XXXXX in the army under Haile Selassie and Mengistu regimes, and that her grandfather was a prominent person in the community. The claimant's high education indicates that she is from a well-to-do family. However, the claimant did not establish that she was persecuted because of that in the past, nor that there is a serious possibility that she would be, should she go back to her country.\nIn the Amnesty International Report for 2002, produced by the counsel with his submissions, we read:\n\"Trials continued of former officials of the government of Mengistu Haile-Mariam (known as the Dergue). They were charged with genocide and other crimes against humanity. Over 2,200 other former officials remained in prison awaiting trial. Scores were convicted and sentenced to prison terms, many were acquitted and at least five were reportedly sentenced to death. In March the Special Prosecutor for the trials said they would be finished in 2004.\"\nNo credible evidence was submitted to the tribunal that those trials concerned in any way the claimant and her family. In Ethiopia, she has her mother, her brother, and four sisters. No evidence was submitted that any of them suffers persecution because they are wife and children of a former XXXXX in the Mengistu government.\nNationality\nNo credible evidence was produced either in support of the claimant's allegation that the Oromos, as a group, are persecuted and in danger in Ethiopia. The documentary evidence, submitted both by the RPO and by counsel, is clear that people suspected of supporting the OLF are being persecuted in Ethiopia. There are also serious human rights abuses by the government against people critical towards the government and promoting the rights of the Oromos, the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia (40 percent of the total population). However, other Oromos collaborate with the government. The Oromia has its regional government. The Oromo People's Democratic Organisation (OPDO) has 178 members in the Parliament, and some ministers and the country President are also Oromos. It is clear to me, based on the documentary evidence, that being an Oromo is not sufficient in order to be persecuted by the present government in Ethiopia. There is no mention from any source that the Oromos, as a group, are in danger in Ethiopia.\nThe claimant was born and lived in XXXXXXXX. She did not establish that in the past, she was persecuted for being Oromo or for any other reason. She held an important position in a government agency, the Ethiopian XXXXXXXXXXX. She continued working there until one week before her departure for Canada. Her entire family, husband, children, mother, sisters, and brother are still living in XXXXXXXX. No credible evidence was submitted that they are suffering persecution because of their nationality.\nBased on all that, I conclude that there is no serious possibility that the claimant would be persecuted in Ethiopia, should she go back to her country, by reason of her Oromo ethnicity.\nDECISION\nConsidering that the claimant's testimony was generally not credible and that the documentary evidence does not support her allegations, I conclude that the claimant, Mrs. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, did not establish a well-founded fear of persecution in Ethiopia, and therefore, she is not a \"Convention refugee\", as per Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. For the same reasons, I conclude that she did not establish that she is a \"person in need of protection\", as per Section 97(1) of the said Act.\nBarbara Berger\nBarbara Berger\nMay 1st, 2003\nDate\n\/jcbo\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - POLITICAL OPINION - NATIONALITY - PARTICULAR SOCIAL GROUP - CREDIBILITY - DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE - FEMALE - ETHIOPIA\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C.

She said that she married for love, just after completing her Baccalaureate in International Accounting at the university.\nIn 1989, her entire family emigrated to Canada. The claimant stayed alone in Egypt with her husband. Following the birth of her elder son, she alleged that her husband forbade her to work so that she would be completely dependent on him.\nIn 1993, she explained, her husband began to exhibit behavioural problems. She claimed that he became more authoritarian and supervised her comings and goings while he went out every night, consumed alcohol and become a chronic liar. The claimant said that he neglected his family obligations and left the family home for short periods without leaving her any money so that she had to borrow to pay the usual household expenses, even though her husband was wealthy. This situation lasted from 1993 to 2000.\nIn March 2001, the claimant discovered that her husband was in an adulterous relationship. He left home for three months. She confronted him and he told her that he was free to live as he wished and she should not interfere. The claimant tried to get help by having a priest from her church intervene to facilitate a reconciliation. She finally resumed living with him.\nHowever, in XXXXX 2001, he continued to see his mistress and the claimant obtained proof of this. She confronted him again, and on this occasion her husband beat her. This sort of scene was repeated on a number of occasions, and the claimant found herself consulting doctors to have her injuries treated. She then contacted members of her family in Canada who advised her to make a complaint to the police.\nThe claimant did not make a complaint to the police because she did not believe that she would have been protected in view of social values in Egypt. Once in Canada and with the support of her family, the claimant took steps to obtain a divorce in Egypt. She also obtained an interim judgment from the Quebec Superior Court for custody of her children and took steps to obtain a legal separation in Canada as well.\nThe claimant explained that she was afraid to return to Egypt because of her fear of her husband. Moreover, the claimant fears that this entire situation involving physical and psychological violence might have a major impact on her young children's equilibrium and development.\nDECISION\nThe panel determines that the claimant and her two children are \"Convention refugees\" in that they fear persecution in Egypt on a Convention ground.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\nThe identity of the claimants for refugee protection was established through the testimony of Ms. XXXXXXX and the documents provided in support of their claims for refugee protection. The documents included the claimant's passport4 containing the registration for the two children, original birth certificates,5 the original marriage certificate6 and a photocopy of the driver's licence.7\nCredibility\nThe panel found that the claimant's testimony was spontaneous, emotional but consistent. There was no contradiction between her testimony and the content of her Personal Information Form (PIF) and there were no omissions.\nRelationship between the spouses\nIn order to demonstrate her difficult relationship with her husband, the claimant provided the originals of medical certificates,8 which show that she was beaten and suffered injuries requiring treatment.\nShe also submitted a letter written by her parish priest in XXXXXX, Quebec, XXXX XXXXXXXXX,9 who, at the request of XXXXXXXX and XXXXXXX of the XXXXXXX XXXXX in Egypt, testified that they had intervened on a number of occasions with the claimant's husband in order to try to resolve the situation, but to no avail. Once in Canada, the claimant attempted to institute divorce proceedings for misconduct and extreme cruelty in Egypt in the court of first instance in XXXX, Cairo, where the hearing was to take place on XXXXXX, 2002.10 She also commenced a proceeding, namely, an application for a legal separation before the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec.11 The claimant's husband, for his part, brought an action for disobedience towards a husband and an application for her to return home and submit to marital authority; a hearing was to take place on XXXXX, 2002 for adjudicating the matter of disobedience towards her husband.12\nThe panel also considered the claimant's testimony about the difficulties she experienced in Egypt and finds that she is a member of the social group of women who are victims of spousal abuse.\nProtection of the state\nAccording to the claimant, a man in Egypt has full authority over his wife, and physical abuse is taken lightly as long as the man has not caused serious injuries.\nAccording to the documentary evidence submitted, there is little or no protection in Egypt for a woman who is the victim of spousal abuse. On this subject, the evidence in Country Reports on Human Rights Practices of the U.S. Department of State,13 published in March 2002, reads as follows:\nLaws affecting marriage and personal status generally correspond to an individual's religion. In January 2000, the Parliament passed a new Personal Status Law that made it easier for a Muslim woman to obtain a divorce without her husband's consent, provided that she is willing to forego alimony and the return of her dowry. (The Coptic Orthodox Church permits divorce only in specific circumstances, such as adultery or conversion of one spouse to another religion.) (...)\nDomestic violence against women is a significant problem and is reflected in press accounts of specific incidents. The law does not prohibit spousal abuse specifically; provisions of law relating to assault in general are applied. According to a national study conducted in 1995 as part of a comprehensive demographic and health survey, one of every three women who have ever been married has been beaten at least once during marriage. Among those who have been beaten, less than half have ever sought help. Smaller, independent studies confirm that wife beating is common. In general neighbors and extended family members intervene to limit incidents of domestic violence. Due to the value attached to privacy in the country's traditional society, abuse within the family rarely is discussed publicly. Spousal abuse is grounds for a divorce; however, the law requires the plaintiff to produce eyewitnesses, a difficult condition to meet. Several NGO's offer counseling, legal aid, and other services to women who are victims of domestic violence. Activists believe that in general the police and the judiciary consider the \"integrity of the family\" more important than the well being of the woman. (...)\nThe claimant explained that she did not attempt to seek protection from the State because she was afraid and she was convinced that making a complaint to the police would aggravate her situation and dishonour her husband's family. She explained that her husband's father was a former XXXXXX; he had many contacts in the police, who might intervene. The result would be to make her situation even more difficult as she lived in an apartment belonging to her father-in-law. Moreover, she explained, in Egypt social values did not favour wives and unless she had her own residence where she could take refugee and unless she had her own financial resources to get by on, she could not separate from her husband; he could obtain a court order to have her return home, which he did in XXXXX 2002.\nWhen she was still in Egypt, she also made inquiries about seeking a divorce but, again, the proceedings are very lengthy and she was financially destitute since she did not work. She preferred to wait until she was in Canada to initiate the proceedings and to have the support of her family in this country.\nThe panel finds that the documentary evidence is consistent with the claimant's testimony.\nInternal flight alternative\nConcerning the possibility of an internal flight alternative for the claimant and her children, the panel finds that this would not have been possible for her. She has not been employed outside her home since the birth of her son, who is now 12 years old. She has no family member in Egypt to help her out financially or otherwise and, in view of the profile of her father-in-law and her husband, she is convinced that her husband would have managed to find them. The panel finds that an internal flight alternative is not a realistic possibility in this particular case.\nImpact on the children\nThere is no exact definition of \"persecution\" in Canadian law or in international refugee law. It is generally accepted, however, that a serious and sustained violation of a fundamental right constitutes persecution within the meaning of the refugee definition.\nIn Baker,14 L'Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J. referred to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, R.T. 1992:\n1. In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.\n2. States Parties undertake to ensure the child such protection and care as is necessary for his or her well-being, taking into account the rights and duties of his or her parents, legal guardians, or other individuals legally responsible for him or her, and, to this end, shall take all appropriate legislative and administrative measures.\nAnd she went on to say:\n(...) the decision-maker should consider children's best interests as an important factor, give them substantial weight, and be alert, alive and sensitive to them.\nThe \"best interests\" of the child should therefore guide the panel in analysing the evidence presented in this case, because a Canadian tribunal may not dissociate itself from the international conventions that Canada has signed. According to the claimant's testimony, it is not alleged that the children were the subject of physical violence at the hands of their father; nonetheless, they suffered psychological abuse in witnessing the mistreatment inflicted by their father on their mother. A return to Egypt would expose the children to the conflicts between their parents and, specifically, to the fact that their mother would have little or no state protection against her husband.\nThe claimant testified that her husband's behaviour towards her had a very negative impact on her children and made them feel insecure; the husband never tried to maintain a good family life and, among other things, abandoned them with no resources for three months.\nSince young children, who are much more emotionally fragile than adults, are involved, the opinion of the panel is that the treatment imposed on their mother and the fact that young children are powerless in such circumstances, that is, the entire situation could have a persecutory effect on them.\nThese two young children belong to the social group of the family and have been exposed to severe and persistent treatment and would continue to be so exposed if they had to return to Egypt. Therefore, the panel finds, as is specified in the Guidelines on Child Refugee Claimants,15 that the best interests of these children warrant international protection.\nPresence of the children in Canada\nBy her own admission, the claimant left Egypt with her children without her husband's agreement. He had given his authorization for travel in the claimant's passport for a previous trip in 1996 and never withdrew that authorization subsequently. The claimant therefore had no problem in leaving Egypt. However, he was not aware of the claimant's travel plans and especially of the fact that she was going to claim refugee status for herself and her children upon her arrival in Canada. The father apparently also mentioned his disagreement to the children during a telephone call. His disagreement is indicated in Exhibit P-1316 as well (certified report by bailiff).\nAlthough these facts may appear troubling, the panel finds that this is not an issue because, on arriving in Canada, the claimant obtained an interim judgment from the Quebec Superior Court granting her interim custody of her children. The document17 was sent to the claimant's husband and he could have sent a notice of objection.\nThe claimant added that her husband did not try to contact his children for a year and a half after their departure. He also did not institute legal proceedings for child abduction. Moreover, the claimant's husband has already been to Canada on a visit to his in-laws and he knows their address and telephone numbers.\nCONCLUSION\nFor all these reasons, the panel determines that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and her two children, XXXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXX, are \"Convention refugees\" pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act in that they have a well-founded fear of persecution in Egypt on a Convention ground.\nDiane Fecteau\nDiane Fecteau\nJune 16, 2003\nDate\n1 Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, reads as follows:\n\"96. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,\n(a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of each of those countries; or\n(b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.\"\n2 Chairperson's Guidelines, Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution, Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB), November 1996, Ottawa.\n3 Section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, reads as follows:\n\"97.

He alleges that he has a well-founded fear of persecution by the military authorities in his country by reason of his political opinion and his membership in a particular social group. Moreover, he claims that he is a \"person in need of protection,\" as he would be subject personally to a danger of torture, to a risk to his life, or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Algeria.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant is from Oran, where he grew up, studied and lived until he left for France.\nThe claimant based his claim for refugee protection firstly on his refusal to do his military service because he believes that the military authorities abuse their power with complete impunity. He claimed that one of his brothers, who was doing his military service, was seriously injured by his captain following a reprimand. In 1996, the claimant was ordered to go for a medical examination twice; he did not go to the examination or to the barracks afterwards. In 2000, he underwent his medical examination and obtained a deferment of his military service that was valid until XXXXXX, 2001, by enrolling in a computer school.\nSecondly, the claimant alleged that conscripts are prime targets for terrorists.\nOn XXXX, 2000, the claimant obtained a visa for France after receiving an invitation to participate in a musical event. When he arrived, he made a refugee claim; his claim was apparently rejected three months later because he was unable to provide a housing and guarantee certificate. In XXXX 2001, the claimant was informed that new call-up papers, dated XXXX, 2001, had been sent to him. He then remained in France illegally until XXXXX, 2001.\nOn December 31, 2001, the claimant arrived in Canada with a false French passport in the name of XXXXXXXXX.\nIf he had to return to Algeria, the claimant, who fears the military tribunal, believes that he would be tortured or that the military would send him to kill people.\nDECISION\nThe panel determines that the claimant is not a \"Convention refugee\" because his fear is not based on one of the five grounds and he is not a \"person in need of protection\" as his removal to Algeria would not subject him personally to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment for the following reasons:\nIdentity\nThe claimant's identity was established by his testimony and the documents provided to support his claim for refugee protection, namely his passport (P-2), his birth certificate (P-3) and his criminal record (P-4).\nCredibility\nThe claimant's testimony was not credible regarding several matters. Moreover, the panel noted a lack of co-operation, especially when he was confronted with contentious issues. In fact, the panel notes that when he arrived on December 31, 2001 at the port of entry in Canada, the claimant did not specify that he was seeking refugee protection by reason of his refusal to do his military service. The reasons stated were as follows:\n[Translation]\nBecause there is unrest in Algeria. It is not safe. It is politically unstable . . . afraid of terrorists.\nIn addition, he stated that he had not done his military service and that it was not compulsory. He also stated that he had not sought asylum in another country.\nWhen confronted concerning these matters, the claimant said that he had not had the assistance of an interpreter because there were none available on December 31 at 6:00 p.m. and that he had misunderstood the questions. The panel has doubts as to the veracity of his answer concerning his knowledge of French because the claimant had come from France, where he had spent two years working. Moreover, he signed the questionnaire as having read and understood the content, and the other answers reveal a good understanding of French.\nMilitary Service in Algeria\nIn order to exempt certain Algerians from military service, the Algerian government introduced a two-stage regularization program. The second stage took place in 2000 and applied to all citizens who would have normally received their call-up papers between 1993 and 1998 (that is those who were born between 1973 and 1978). In this stage the following people were exempted from military service:\n* Deferred conscripts and those who had received call-up papers;\n* Those whose application for exemption was still pending;\n* Those who had not yet received their call-up papers or who had not been ordered to report for the medical examination as part of the screening for military service;\n* Those who had not responded to the order to report for the medical examination;\n* Those who were charged with draft evasion (it is assumed that the charge was still pending).\nThe claimant belongs to the category of citizens who received their call-up papers between 1993 and 1998, since he was born in 1976. At that time, he was also a deferred conscript; his deferment was valid until XXXXX, 2001. The two stages of regularization applied to Algerians living in Algeria and those living abroad.\nWhen the panel asked whether the claimant was aware of this possibility while he was in France and whether he had applied for regularization, the panel found that the claimant's behaviour raised a serious doubt because the panel had to ask him this question five times and it still did not obtain a straight answer. Among other things, he answered: [Translation] \"I was not in the country;\" \"I do not have the right to enter the Consulate;\" \"I do not have the documents;\" \"I do not know where the Consulate is;\" and \"My father did it; where would I have done it?\"\nAccording to the documentary evidence referred to above, in order to apply for regularization, the person concerned had to go to an Algerian diplomatic office while abroad with a birth certificate, an identification document, two photographs and his diploma or proof that he was a student at an educational institution, depending on the circumstances. The claimant had these documents, as well as a valid Algerian passport.\nMoreover, this document specifies that those (Algerians) who had not met the application deadlines could still apply for an exemption at an Algerian diplomatic office abroad. If their applications were in order, they would receive their military exemption card. If the claimant did not do this and submitted a copy of new call-up papers dated XXXXX, 2001, he would then be part of a group that is ineligible for the regularization program, namely the category of \"draft evaders.\" The military tribunal, of which the claimant is afraid, issues wanted notices for the draft evaders, who cannot obtain exemptions. Draft evaders are not granted any sort of amnesty. If they return to Algeria, they will be brought before a military tribunal authorized to judge and sentence them. A person who is found guilty of draft evasion is liable to 18 months of military service, imprisonment for up to 36 months, or both.\nHowever, the panel notes that Exhibit A-5 indicates the following:\n4.48 However, more recent reports state that absentees are not treated so harshly by the authorities as in the past. The Algerian authorities informed the Canadian Embassy in Algiers in March 1999 that people suspected of being absent without leave are arrested by the police and immediately brought before a military tribunal which \"is free to decide the punishment for the individual\", according to the law. They stated that absence without leave is not considered to be a major issue by the Algerian authorities: those convicted of this offence are usually sent to their units to do their national service.\n4.49 The same source quotes the two Algerian human rights organisations - the Observatoire national des droits de l'homme (ONDH), which is linked to the state, and the Ligue alg\u00e9rienne des droits de l'homme (LADH). They have stated that they have received no complaints regarding torture of deserters and draft evaders. Both these organisations also indicate that the situation today is considerably different from what it was in the 1970s, when soldiers who were absent without leave might have been treated more harshly.\n4.50 A professor specialising in Algerian military affairs at the Centre d'\u00e9tudes et de recherches internationales in Paris, Luis Martinez, also believes that young Algerians who return to Algeria are not tortured if they have not fulfilled their military obligations.\n4.51 A country report by the Canadian Immigration authority in 2001 also states that the tendency is for draft evaders to receive more lenient sentences, especially for those who merely sought to avoid doing their service and the latter are therefore often only sentenced to do their normal service term...\nThe claimant explained that his fears and his dread of doing his military service were related to his brother's situation; his brother had apparently been seriously injured by the captain of his unit. The claimant submitted copies of medical documents that seem to be related to his brother; however, the panel is of the opinion that these documents do not allow it to conclude that his brother was assaulted by his captain.\nMoreover, the claimant explained that one of his reasons for not doing his military service was the acts of violence that the army had allegedly committed in his area. Several international reports from diplomatic missions discuss possible acts of violence and investigation or lack thereof into these acts of violence. However, the panel notes the following remarks from Exhibit A-2, a report published in May 2001 by Brian J. Davis, Immigration counsellor at the Canadian Embassy in Algeria:\n[Translation]\nAs for who, apart from the armed Islamist groups, is responsible for the killings and why the attacks continue to take place so frequently, there are many theories. For example, some say that the security forces themselves commit some of the attacks, not by reason of any official policy whatsoever, but rather at the instigation of officers in certain areas of the country who have deserted. However, evidence is scarce because the attacks take place in isolated regions, and the government is reticent about security matters, even though for the last two years, it has been more willing than before to reveal certain details of field operations conducted by the security forces. In general, although some people (including a victim of the Bentalha massacre who recently published a controversial work) accuse the army of having been party to a number of massacres or not having done anything to stop them in the past, people seem generally to believe that today the army endeavours to fulfil its obligations.\nThe panel is of the opinion that the evidence submitted by the claimant on this matter is insufficient for it to find that his fears are founded.\nBased on the following extracts from Exhibit A-5, the panel understands that the situation in Algeria, although very complex, has improved, especially in Oran, where the claimant is from. The panel also notes that the problem of terrorism still exists; however, the entire population is faced with a generalized risk:\n4.54 Between 1993 and 1995 Islamists put up posters in mosques threatening to kill young Algerians who reported for military service and the death of hundreds of such draftees was reported around 1994. Several human rights report referred to the position of draftees who feel caught between the military authorities and the terrorists. Most newspaper reports of such cases are dated 1994 and 1995. However, there were still occasional reports of young men who have just finished their military service being victims of terrorists attacks.\n4.55 It has been claimed that a number of measures taken by the government have diminished this type of Islamist activity and that the \"terrorists\" mainly launch general attacks against the civilian population in the regions rather than targeting specific individuals. A country situation report by the Dutch immigration authorities in 2001 states that there is generally no sign at present of violence against conscripts who had just completed their military service and return to civilian life, in contrast to the first years of terrorism. However, the Salafist Group for Call and Combat (GSPC) armed group, which is a splinter of the GIA group, targets the military and conscripts within areas of operation.\n5.A.8 The Algerian authorities are in control of the vast majority of their territory. As most people live in towns, many having voluntarily relocated for personal security reasons, the present violence is not a major feature of most people's day to day lives. High unemployment and the difficult transition from the centrally managed economy to a market economy mean that social unrest is the norm among the Algerian population, which has recently become apparent among the population, in particular in Kayla.\n5.B.19 It is essentially rural terrorism that is taking place except in the stronghold of the armed groups. Some cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants are affected by terrorist activities e.g. Khemis, Miliana and Ain Delfa. The situation in Algiers and Constantine is relatively calm, although some networks still exist. There are also some networks in Annaba and sporadic attacks in Blida. Oran and Nostaganem are also relatively calm as far as terrorism is concerned. More than 50% of attacks in 2000 were carried out in areas west of Algiers, manly in the provinces of Medea, Ain Defla and Tipaza (including Tenes), and to a lesser degree, relatively speaking, in the Chlef region. The GIA is active in this region Residue pockets of the GIA also exist further west in Relizane, Mascara, Tiaret and Saida. The GSPC is mainly active in the region east of Algiers between Boumerdes province and part of Kabylie.\nThe panel is of the opinion that, if the claimant returned to live in Oran, he would not be targeted any more by \"terrorists\" than other people who live in the area. The claimant did not demonstrate that he could be targeted as alleged.\nParallel to this situation, Exhibit A-21 provides the following information on the attitude of Algerians regarding military service:\n[Translation]\nIn general, the attitude of the Algerians with whom I spoke about military service was clear: they consider that it is a national duty and they expect men to fulfil their duty, no matter what their personal opinions are. None of the people I spoke with showed much compassion or understanding for those who claim refugee status abroad in order to shirk their responsibility. Even those who were the parents of young men stated in a completely neutral manner that military service is something every Algerian is called upon to do for his country. Neither LADD* nor the ONDH* has ever received complaints that military service violated human rights.\n(LADD: Ligue alg\u00e9rienne de la d\u00e9fense des droits de l'homme and ONDH: Observatoire national des droits de l'homme)\nThe panel finds that, given the fact that he is Algerian, the claimant is required to perform his military service. This is a law of general application and unless he has obtained an exemption, he runs the risk of incurring certain penalties.\nThe panel is of the opinion that this does not constitute cruel and unusual treatment or punishment but is rather a lawful sanction.\nCONCLUSION\nFor all these reasons, the panel determines that XXXXXXXXX is not a \"Convention refugee\"2 under section 96 of the Act, as he does not have a well-founded fear of persecution in Algeria based on a Convention ground. Moreover, the panel determines that the claimant is not a \"person in need of protection\" as his removal to Algeria would not subject him personally to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment under section 97(1)3 of the Act.\nDiane Fecteau\nDiane Fecteau\nApril 29, 2003\nDate\n1 Exhibit A-2: Report on Algeria: Fact-finding mission from January 20 to 26, 2001.\n2 \"96. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,\n(a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or\n(b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.\"\n3 \" 97.

He has alleged a well-founded fear of persecution in Peru by XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX because of the particular social group to which he belongs, that of the family. He further claims that he is a person in need of protection in that there would be a risk to his life and that he would be subject to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if he were to return to his country.\nPRELIMINARY AND INCIDENTAL PROCEEDINGS\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX claim for refugee protection is based on that of his 21-year-old daughter XXXXXX. However, to ensure that the claimant's daughter would not be questioned by the Minister's counsel concerning the exclusion, and with the consent of all parties, the panel decided to separate the cases.\nThe Minister's representative participated in the hearing, in accordance with paragraph 170(e) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and Rule 25 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules.\nSUMMARY OF ALLEGED FACTS\nThe claimant worked for many years for the Peruvian National Police (PNP), previously known as the Civil Guard (CG). He alleged that he had left Peru for the following reasons.\nThe claimant's daughter met XXXXXXXXXXX in 1998. In XXXXXX 1999, she ran away from the family home to go to live with her boyfriend. In XXXXX 1999, she left him and returned to live at her parents' home. On XXXXXX, 1999, her ex-boyfriend came to her home to ask her to return to live with him. When the claimant expressed his refusal, Mr. XXXXXX attacked him.\nOn XXXXXX, 1999, the claimant's daughter was assaulted in the street by her ex-boyfriend. When she returned from the hospital, she went to the police to file a complaint, accompanied by the claimant. The police did not take her seriously and did not respond. In XXXX 2000, the claimant and his daughter were assaulted again and filed another complaint with the police, with no more success than the first time.\nThings then calmed down, but since the claimant's daughter could not concentrate on her studies, her parents sent her to school in the United States, where she stayed for a year before returning to Peru. The claimant further alleged that he himself had been persecuted and threatened for intervening on his daughter's behalf. He alleged that on XXXXXX, 2001, after his daughter had returned from the United States, her ex-boyfriend, XXXXXXXXXXX, wanted to take her away by force. The claimant objected to this and was injured by Mr. XXXXXXX friends. The claimant then decided to leave Peru with his daughter.\nFour days before leaving, the claimant was assaulted again. He left his country on XXXX, 2002, passed through the United States and arrived in Canada.\nThe Minister's representative made the following arguments.\nOn his Personal Information Form (PIF), the claimant indicated that he had been a member of the Peruvian National Police from XXXXX 1971 to XXXXXX 1989. Numerous reports from several sources indicate that the Peruvian National Police is an organization that has committed crimes against humanity as defined in the international instruments. For the period during which the claimant was working there, the documentary evidence describes numerous crimes, namely torture, disappearances, serious abuses and grave violations of fundamental rights. Lastly, in the circumstances, there are serious reasons for considering that the claimant participated in the perpetration of crimes against humanity or was complicit in such crimes.\nDECISION\nAfter meticulously analysing the whole of the evidence submitted, the panel rejects XXXXXXXXXXXX claim for refugee protection, first because he is not credible with respect to certain aspects of his story, and second because, under Articles 1F(a) and (c) of the Convention, he must be excluded from the protection granted to refugees1 and persons in need of protection.2\nANALYSIS\nInclusion\nBefore addressing the issue of exclusion, the panel will consider the validity of the refugee protection claimant's fear.\nThe claimant's identity was established, in accordance with section 106 of the Act, by various documents, namely his voting book, his passport and a police identity card.\nXXXXXXXXXX claim is based on that of his daughter. The panel rejected the latter's claim since it found that her story was not plausible. The claim made by the father, XXXXXX XXXXX XXXXXXX, who stated that he had been persecuted by the same student (his daughter's ex-boyfriend), is rejected because the panel finds it implausible that a young man (allegedly the ex-boyfriend of the claimant's daughter) could, with impunity, attack someone who had had a career with the police and who worked in the XXXXX XXXXXX of a large company. Moreover, there are no documents corroborating the existence of this ex-boyfriend of the claimant's daughter - no photos, clarifications or details. It is especially worth noting that this person, if he really existed, was only a student at the time.\nMedical certificates were filed but they do not prove to the panel that, if injuries were actually inflicted on the claimant, they were inflicted by this ex-boyfriend, whose existence was not corroborated by any evidence. Even if this individual existed, the panel finds it implausible that a former police officer would not be able to obtain the State's protection. The claimant adduced Exhibit P-8, which is a complaint filed with the Peruvian National Police, the same organization at which he worked for 20 years. The claimant explained that nothing had been done to protect him from this individual. The panel does not find this answer very convincing in light of his past work. Furthermore, the claimant's entire family, spouse and children, are still living in Peru. The panel finds it difficult to imagine that even if this ex-boyfriend existed he would still hold a grudge against the claimant.\nExclusion\nAccording to the documentary evidence, specifically according to Amnesty International:3\n[TRANSLATION]\nMembers of the Civil Guard, army troops and naval fusiliers stopped and questioned, tortured and murdered suspects, set fire to houses and threatened or repressed entire communities. (...)\n(...) The National Police is comprised of three units:\n* (...)\n* the Civil Guard, the main uniformed police force, responsible for the anti-insurrection program. It is frequently referred to in reports on incommunicado detention, \"disappearances\" and political assassinations.\nThis evidence clearly establishes that the Peruvian National Police committed abuses that can be considered crimes against humanity. Since the claimant was a member of this police force, the panel finds that there are serious reasons for considering that he was complicit in such crimes. The claimant held various positions within the PNP between 1971 and 1989.\nThe exclusion set out in articles 1F(a) and 1F(c) of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees is worded as follows:\nThe provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:\n(a) He has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes;\n(b) (...)\n(c) He has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\nThe claimant alleged that he was responsible only for traffic and road accidents, but the evidence adduced clearly indicates that he held a variety of other positions, such as XXXXXX XXXXX XXXXXX section in Juliaca, XXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXX in Lima Callao from 1987 to 1989. In the panel's opinion, the claimant is significantly downplaying the scope of his work, confining it to traffic matters. The panel is of the opinion that he is not speaking the truth when he states that he does not know what happened to the people who were arrested.\nThe panel applied the test established by MacGuigan J. in Ramirez4 to determine whether an individual is complicit in a crime against humanity. Six criteria are set out to that effect.\nRecruitment methods\nThe claimant joined the police force voluntarily, went to the police academy and worked there for close to 20 years.\nNature of the organization\nThe Peruvian National Police is accustomed to using violence and torture to obtain information on terrorists and the population as well as on opponents to the regime. The documentary evidence reports the following facts.\nThe past eighteen months have seen a persistent rise in the gross abuse of human rights in Peru (...)\nOver the past seven years some 3,000 prisoners held in government custody have \"disappeared\". Thousands more have been killed outright by government forces in mass executions and selective assassinations. (...)\n(...) military forces and police units directly responsible to civilian authorities were alleged to be responsible for the gross violations of human rights in 1988 and the first half of 1989 as the incidence of killing and disappearance increased. (...)\nThe true number of the dead remains unknown as police removed the bodies in trucks to an unknown destination (...)\nCivilian and police gunmen believed to be acting on the authority and at the direction of civilian functionaries in the Ministry of Interior have been reported responsible for extrajudicial executions and disappearances outside the emergency zones - including in the capital, Lima. (...)\nTorture\nEvidence of torture as a tool of interrogation, a punishment, and a cause of death has been received from the emergency zones as well as the capital, Lima. Torture of prisoners in the secret custody of the armed forces in the emergency zones is the norm, with Civil Guard forces also frequently reported to have tortured detainees. In some emergency zones practices reportedly differed, with prisoners reporting relatively good treatment once they were transferred from the custody of the army, navy, or Civil Guard to the PIP: the normal procedure for prisoners who are to be either released or taken before the courts.5\nWhen confronted with this evidence, the claimant provided vague and evasive answers that were not very convincing.\nPosition and rank within the organization\nThe claimant made a career in this organization and rose to the rank of XXXXXX, which is considered a position with a high level of trust.\nKnowledge of atrocities\nGiven his rank, the claimant could not have been unaware of the atrocities committed by the Peruvian National Police, even if he did not give much information on this subject. It is implausible that the claimant would be unaware of the abuses committed by the police.\nPossibility of leaving the organization\nThe claimant stayed with the police force voluntarily from 1971 to 1989. He could have left at any time without exposing himself to any risk. Moreover, he stated that he had left the police not because he was distancing himself from them and the abuses they committed but because he received better pay at his new job - in the security service of a large company.\nLength of association with the organization\nThe claimant spent close to 20 years with the police force.\nIn the final analysis, given that the panel has determined that there are serious reasons for considering that the claimant committed a crime against humanity as defined in the international instruments, clause 1F(c) partly applies, since it is indeed obvious that a crime against humanity is an act contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\nCONCLUSION\nIn light of the above analysis, the panel excludes XXXXX XXXX XXXXX from the application of the definition, since there are serious reasons for considering that he was complicit in the commission of crimes against humanity by virtue of his ongoing participation over many years in the activities of the Peruvian National Police. The claimant is therefore a member of the class of excluded persons as defined in clauses 1F(a) and 1F(c) of the Convention.\nJoulekhan Pirbay\nJoulekhan Pirbay\nAugust 15, 2003\nDate\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - SOCIAL GROUP - FAMILY - CREDIBILITY - EXCLUSION - ARTICLES 1F(a) and (c) - COMPLICIT - CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY - DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE - MALE - NEGATIVE - PERU\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, reads in part as follows:\n96.

Mr. XXXXXXXXX is a Colombian citizen. Ms. XXXXXXXX and her two children are citizens of Ecuador.\nMs. XXXXXXXXX, the minor children's mother, was designated as their representative for the purposes of the hearing.\nALLEGED FACTS\nIn the first Personal Information Form (PIF),1 signed on May 17, 2002, the principal claimant alleged the following facts.\nThe 39-year-old principal claimant was born on XXXXXXXXX, 1963 in the city of Medellin in Colombia. He graduated from XXXXX university in Medellin in 1986 and worked as a XXXXX from 1991 until he left Colombia. His 37-year-old wife was born in the city of Guano in Ecuador on XXXX, 1965. Her two children were also born in Ecuador.\nHis problems started in Medellin, Colombia in late 1998 when he received some very strange calls from unknown individuals asking him for information about his clients - entrepreneurs, judicial authorities, politicians and a few members of the military. Although he did not have any specific information about them, he refused to cooperate with the people who were uttering these threats over the telephone for fear that the goal was attempted kidnapping, theft or extortion. The people making the calls identified themselves as members of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]), an extreme leftist guerilla group in Colombia. He replied that he would inform the police of their demands. He was told that he and his family were being watched and that if he spoke to the police, his family would suffer the consequences. The claimant alleged that he continued to receive such calls but that he always replied that he did not have any information since contact with clients was handled through the company for which he worked. The claimant moved and changed his telephone number in XXXXXX 1999.\nIn XXXXX 1999, the telephone calls from the FARC members began again. The claimant gave them the same answer. On XXXXXXX, 1999, he was intercepted by four people who got out of a car and threatened him again, telling him that his children would be the victims if he did not cooperate. In XXXXX 2000, the claimant left the country with his family and went to Ecuador, where he tried to settle and return to work. In Ecuador, he suffered discrimination because he was Colombian and all Colombians are considered drug traffickers there. The claimant then decided to go to the United States with his family. He left Ecuador for Miami on XXXXX 28. He lived and worked in the United States for close to two years. On April 11, 2002, the claimant and his family arrived at the Canadian border and claimed refugee status there. They alleged that if they were to return to Colombia or Ecuador, their lives would be in danger from the FARC because of their refusal to cooperate.\nIn the second PIF,2 filed on June 25, 2003, the claimant made some changes to his narrative and alleged the following facts.\nThe claimant's problems started on XXXXXX, 1996, when he began receiving strange telephone calls from unknown individuals asking him for information about his clients, who were rich and influential people. Fearing that these individuals wanted to commit extortion or forcible confinement, he refused to give them any information and threatened to inform the police.\nOn XXXXX, 1996, the claimant received a second similar call. This time the caller identified himself as a member of the FARC. The claimant was given eight days to provide them with the information they were asking for. His aggressors informed him that they had all of the details about the family, home, school, etc. and threatened him with reprisals if he reported them to the police. Afraid for his life and the lives of his family, the claimant did not file a complaint and the family decided to go to Ecuador to live in XXXX 1997. He stayed there for 7 months, until XXXXX 1997. On XXXXX 20, 1997, the claimant went back to Colombia by himself to live and work, travelling frequently to Ecuador to visit his family, who had stayed there.\nThree years later, on XXXXX, 2000, the claimant received another telephone call from the FARC members reminding him that they had not forgotten him and repeating the same demands on threat of death. The aggressor indicated to him that they knew everything about his family in Ecuador - their address, the children's school, etc. To win some time, the claimant agreed to provide them with what they were asking for and immediately fled to a friend's house to hide. Two days later, on XXXXXX, he sought protection from the authorities in Medellin (Fiscalia). He was told that this was useless. Since he could not count on his country's protection, he left Colombia permanently on XXXX and joined his family in Ecuador.\nOn XXXXXX, 2000, he sought protection against the FARC from the Ecuadorian authorities for himself and his family but received the same reply. Finding themselves once again without protection, the claimant and his family decided to leave Ecuador for the United States. They arrived in Miami on XXXX, 2000 and stayed there until XXXXX, 2002.\nANALYSIS\nThe panel has considered the two narratives submitted by the claimant and his family. It has reviewed his testimony at the hearing and has taken into account the documentary evidence from the claimants' two countries of nationality. The panel has determined that the claimants are not Convention refugees and are not persons in need of protection for the following reasons.\nThe panel noted numerous contradictions between the second narrative filed by the claimant shortly before his hearing in July 2003 and the one included in his PIF of May 2002. Aside from these contradictions, numerous facts are related differently and the dates do not coincide. Moreover, certain important facts are omitted and others added. The panel therefore had to consider two different accounts in which there were differences of two and sometimes three years in the dates on which the important events occurred.\nFor example, in his original narrative, the claimant alleged that his problems started in late 1998, while in the second, the same events took place precisely on XXXXXX, 1996 and XXXXX, 1996. Again in the second narrative, the claimant left Colombia for Ecuador with his family in XXXXX 1997 and lived there for seven months before returning to Colombia by himself to work, his family having stayed in Ecuador. However, in the first narrative, he alleged that it was following new threatening calls from the FARC in XXXX 1999 that he left Colombia with his family in XXXXX 2000 to go to Ecuador to live. In the second narrative, these new calls from the FARC took place on XXXXX, 2000.\nIn the first narrative, the claimant makes no mention of a seven-month stay in Ecuador or of his subsequent return to Colombia. The second narrative makes no mention of an alleged assault in the street by FARC members on XXXXX, 1999. There is a considerable amount of confusion as a result, and this tends to impede understanding of all the other information contained in the family members' PIF. All of the information must be called into question. The panel finds that the contradictions and changes are too numerous and too significant not to undermine the claimant's credibility and to cast serious doubt on his allegations.\nIn the submission of the second document, the claimant holds his first lawyer and the interpreter responsible for all of the errors made in his PIF. He alleged that this lawyer's interpreter invented a number of facts and that he could not make the necessary changes since he did not understand French. He further alleged that the interpreter had been in a great hurry when they met and had refused to correct the mistakes that the claimant had pointed out to him at that time, deferring everything to a later meeting. The claimant allegedly signed his PIF trusting in him that he would receive the corrected documents later.\nWhen questioned about this at the hearing, the claimant repeated that he had pointed out the errors to the interpreter and had asked him to correct them. The latter had promised that he would send the corrected copies. When the panel asked him if the handwritten answer to question 37 on pages 8, 9 and 10 was included, the claimant answered that he did not know what was on the record. He subsequently changed his testimony, stating that the handwritten text was in the PIF. The claimant was undoubtedly aware of the content of his narrative written in French since he stated that had pointed out the mistakes that appeared there to the interpreter. Moreover, the panel finds it difficult to understand how so many errors and contradictions could have slipped in between the Spanish text that the claimant submitted to the interpreter and the resulting French translation. The onus is on the claimant to ensure that his claim for protection is progressing properly and he cannot simply abandon all of his obligations by automatically casting all of the blame on his first lawyer and the interpreter. The panel rejects these explanations as far-fetched.\nGiven the considerable differences between the two texts, the major contradictions and the significant additions and omissions, the panel has no choice but to find that the claimant lacks credibility overall.3 Since it cannot trust either of the two versions of the claimant's story, the panel does not believe that the claimant was persecuted by FARC terrorists as he claims or that his life would be in danger if he were to return to his country.\nThe panel further determines that the claimant's return to Colombia after the FARC's alleged threats and the time he spent in the United States without claiming refugee status constitute evidence undermining his subjective fear and damaging his credibility even further.\nCONCLUSION\nFor all of these reasons, the panel determines that there is less than a reasonable chance that the principal claimant would be persecuted if he were to return to Colombia, his country of origin.4 Since his wife and her children have Ecuadorian citizenship, they cannot make a claim against Colombia. Moreover, since the panel does not grant any credibility to the principal claimant's allegations, the panel does not believe that the claimants would be in any danger if they were to return to Ecuador.\nDECISION\nConsequently, the panel determines that the claimants, XXXXXXXXXXXXXX, his wife, XXXXXXXXXXXXXX, and their two minor children, XXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX, are not Convention refugees5 or persons in need of protection.6\nThe panel rejects their claim for protection.\nJeannine Beaubien-Duque\nJeannine Beaubien-Duque\nSeptember 8, 2003\nDate\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - PERSONAL INFORMATION FORM - CONTRADICTIONS - CREDIBILITY - MALE - FEMALE - NEGATIVE - COLOMBIA - ECUADOR\n1 Exhibit P-1: Claimant's Personal Information Form (PIF) dated May 17, 2002.\n2 Exhibit P-10: Corrections to Personal Information Form (PIF) dated June 25, 2003.\n3 Sheikh, Abdulhakim Ali v.

They are alleging a well-founded fear of persecution in their country by corrupt police officers, by reason of the principal claimant's imputed political opinion and by reason of his wife's and minor child's membership in a particular social group, the family. Furthermore, they maintain that they are \"persons in need of protection.\"\nPreliminary procedures\nXXXXXXXXXXX was designated by the panel to represent the minor, XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX. The story of the mother and child is based on the story of XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXX.\nSUMMARY OF ALLEGED FACTS\nMr. XXXXXXX was taken into custody, handcuffed to a desk and made to lie on the floor by police officers as a result of a problem with the delivery of some uniforms. He was awakened by a noise late in the night and witnessed a transaction between the mayor, XXXXX, and the XXXXXXX police, a drug trafficker, regarding the murder of a poor peasant who had been previously beaten and tortured.\nThe claimant was released the afternoon of XXXXXX, when his father intervened. He immediately filed a complaint in order to protect the rights of the peasants and indigenous people, who are considered less than nothing and who are killed for the slightest reasons.\nConsequently, the claimant was considered an embarrassing witness and became a target for murder. His life threatened, the claimant had to leave his country.\nANALYSIS\nHaving examined all of the evidence, the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) determines that the principal claimant, XXXXXXXXXXXXX, his wife, XXXXXXXXXXXXX and their child, XXXXXXXXXXXX, are \"persons in need of protection,\"1 in accordance with the provisions of section 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nOnce the identities of XXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXX XXXXX were established in accordance with the provisions of section 106 of the Act, the onus was on the panel to determine whether the claimants for refugee protection were indeed \"Convention refugees.\"2\nThe principal claimant alleged a fear of persecution because he had witnessed a murder and he had denounced the authorities. The claimant's fear of persecution is not founded by reasons listed in the Convention. Consequently, we determine that the claimant is not a \"Convention refugee.\"\nPerson in need of protection\nThe panel considered the provisions of section 97(1)(b) of the Act and determines that XXXXXXX XXXXXXX is a \"person in need of protection\" because he and his family could be subject to a risk to their lives.\nThe claimant's narrative was simple and credible. There were no contradictions, discrepancies or major omissions in his story. The claimant alleged he did not file the complaint because of what happened to him personally, since the police were corrupt and he did not expect to obtain any justice. However, he was compelled to denounce the abuses committed against a poor, defenceless peasant who had been beaten, tortured, and then killed in cold blood by corrupt police officers by order of the mayor.\nThe claimant therefore became an embarrassing witness, a target for murder and, consequently, if he were to return to Mexico, he would risk being subjected to the same treatment as the peasant, that is, being beaten and killed. This therefore constitutes a risk to his life and to the lives of his family members.\nLawful sanctions\nA careful and comprehensive analysis of all the evidence showed that the risk to the claimant's life is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions.\nPersonal or generalized risk\nThe claimant for refugee protection demonstrated that, if he were to return to Mexico, his life and the lives of his family members would be at risk, given their particular circumstances. The claimant is being sought because he poses a definite threat to certain high-ranking police officers, because he was a witness to torture and murder. He knows the names of those who committed the crime he denounced.\nIn his case, the claimant does not face a random risk, which other individuals from that country would generally face.\nStandard of proof\nHaving examined the standard of proof applicable to assessing the risk of persecution under section 97(1), the panel decided to apply the standard established in Adjei3 and used to define \"Convention refugee,\" because it thinks this is the standard of proof that should be applied to the facts in this case. The panel finds, with good reason, that there is a serious possibility that XXXXXX XXXXXXX XXXXXXX would be subject to a risk to his life if he returned to his country, and that his family would face the same risk.\nState protection\nAlthough states are presumed capable of protecting their citizens, the claimant was free, according to the Act, to rebut this presumption of protection by clear and convincing evidence. In light of the evidence given, the panel finds that the claimant succeeded in rebutting this presumption. Since the State itself is the agent of persecution, it is clear that State protection is not a reasonable alternative.\nInternal flight alternative\nHaving found the claimant to be credible, the panel was duty bound to ascertain whether he and his family could seek refuge in another city. According to our assessment of the evidence, since the agents of persecution who are seeking the claimant are high-ranking government officials, his life and the lives of his family members would be at risk everywhere in the country.\nCONCLUSION\nConsidering that the evidence on the record and the testimony given at the hearing confirm the alleged facts and the grounds for the fears described, the panel accepts the claim for refugee protection filed by XXXXXXXXXXXXXX, his wife, XXXXXXXXXXXXXX, and their child, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, who are \"persons in need of protection,\" in accordance with the provisions of section 97(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nJoulekhan Pirbay\nJoulekhan Pirbay\nJuly 25, 2003\nDate\n\/mc\/jcbo\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C.

A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion\na) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or\nb) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.\"\n3 Adjei v.

His work was dangerous and highly demanding, but better paid.\nThe claimant stated that during union meetings-and in particular at the meeting of XXXXXX, 2001-he always demanded something, such as paid overtime or wage increases.\nHe stated that later on, namely on XXXX, 2001, individuals came to his home while he was away, took out a pistol and threatened the claimant's father, saying that the claimant would be killed if he continued to stir things up with the union. After this incident, the claimant's father died, on XXXX, 2001 at the age of 76.\nThe claimant stated that on XXXXX, 2001, in the course of a meeting, he told everyone that he was going to denounce corruption to the authorities in charge of the company at the general meeting of XXXXX, 2001. He was thus called in to discuss matters with a boss of the business, a German, and to inform him of what was happening in the factory.\nThe claimant said that on the night of XXXXX, 2001, he received a death threat by telephone. He believed he recognized the voice of his enemy XXXXX, who also threatened to attack the claimant's girlfriend.\nFaced with this situation, the claimant decided to get married on XXXXXXX, 2001, with a view to leaving the country. He continued to work until XXXXXX, 2002, the date on which the engineer XXXXXX asked him to sign his resignation.\nThat same night of XXXXX, 2002, two individuals came to the claimant's home while his wife was alone. They threatened to kill the claimant if she did not leave XXXXX. The claimants thus departed from Mexico on XXXXX, 2002 and arrived in Canada the same day. They claimed refugee status on May 15, 2002.\nIDENTITY\nThe panel is satisfied as to the identity of the refugee protection claimants, given the claimants' testimony and the exhibits that were filed: identity card, voter's card, passports, etc.\nGROUNDS OF THE CLAIM FOR REFUGEE PROTECTION\nThe refugee protection claimants informed the panel that their claims were based on the principal claimant's membership in a particular social group, as a member of a union.\nCREDIBILITY\nThe panel found that the refugee protection claimant was not a credible witness and therefore does not find reliable what the claimant alleged in support of his claim.\nDETERMINATION\nThe panel is of the opinion that the claimants have not discharged the burden on them of proving that they face a reasonable chance of persecution in the event of their return to their country of citizenship. Consequently, the panel determines that the claimants are not \"Convention refugees\";1 neither are they \"persons in need of protection\"2 pursuant to section 97 (1)(a) or (b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The panel further determines that this claim has no credible basis.\nANALYSIS\nThe principal claimant stated at the hearing that he had decided to leave Mexico after receiving the death threats on XXXXX, 2002. The refugee protection officer (RPO) then pointed out to the claimant that he and his wife had obtained their passports on XXXXX, 2002 and their driver's licences on XXXXX, 2002. The date XXXX, 2002 corresponds to the date indicated in the claimant's answer to Question 37 of the PIF, at page 5.\nHowever, in the port-of-entry notes, at the bottom of page 3, the claimant indicates that he realized that his life was in danger in XXXXX 1998. When confronted with this contradiction, he declared that at the port of entry, the officer had misunderstood him, that he was confused.\nExhibit P-13 is a business card of Mr. XXXXX, production engineer with XXXXXX. The spelling of this name on the business card is different from the name as it appears in the PIF, namely \"XXXXXXX\", and is also different from the name appearing in the first Exhibit P-2, which was filed on December 2, 2002 and which the interpreter translated from Spanish to French. In that document, which is apparently an official document of the Attorney General, the company's name is given as \"XXXXXXX.\" When confronted with these differences in the spelling of the company's name, the claimant declared that he had little experience in writing. The panel concludes from this that the Attorney General no doubt did not make a mistake, and that the writing must refer to a company other than \"XXXXXX.\" This is a popular name, since in Exhibit T-2, one finds a company by the name of \"XXXXXXX\", which is a group working on XXXXX XXXXX XXXX.\nMoreover, when questioned about the address of the company \"XXXXX\", the claimant stated that it was situated at XXXXXX Street, while the business card gives the company's address as XXXXX Street, on the other side of the street. Then the claimant said that the factory was located on \"XXXXXX\" Street, the main street in \"XXXXX\" and that XXXX Street is a neighbourhood. He reiterated that the factory was on \"XXXXX\" Street, but said he did not know the number on the door. The panel finds that all these contradictions undermine the credibility of the refugee protection claimant and does not believe that the claimant worked for \"XXXXXX\" in the past, as no evidence to that effect has been presented to the panel. In the nearly eight months that he has been in Canada, the claimant has not asked his mother to send him paycheque stubs-which he says are in his mother's possession-or his union card, work certificate and work overalls, which he also had at his mother's home. He did obtain a work certificate dated XXXXX, 2002 for his wife, but no documents concerning his work at the factory.\nA person who claims refugee protection has a legal obligation to provide the information and documents that the rules of the Board require. In this regard, rule 7 provides that\n7. The claimant must provide [to the Refugee Protection Division] acceptable documents establishing identity and other elements of the claim. A claimant who does not provide acceptable documents must explain why they were not provided and what steps were taken to obtain them.\nThe panel thus finds that the refugee protection claimant did not take the minimum steps required to obtain the necessary evidence, which would have indicated his employment with \"XXXXXX.\" The explanations he gave to the panel as to why he did not obtain this evidence are unsatisfactory as this evidence would have been of much greater probative value than his wife's work certificate.\nWhen questioned as to why he had obtained a work certificate for his wife but nothing concerning himself, the claimant replied that he did not want to contact anyone in his country, because he did not want to inform anyone of where he was. He testified, however, that in XXXXX 2002, he contacted a friend in XXXXX.\nThe panel does not accept this explanation, especially since the claimant testified that his persecutors demanded that he leave \"XXXX\", not Mexico, and that he did not know that he could live elsewhere in Mexico because there was no publicity in XXXXX to that effect. He also said that he preferred to start over from scratch in Canada rather than in Mexico, for in his opinion, wages are better here in Canada than they are in Mexico.\nThis leads the panel to find that the alleged persecution in the present case was not the work of agents of the state, but rather of certain members of the union. Moreover, by the claimant's own admission, there is an internal flight alternative for him and for his wife in Mexico, in some place other than XXXXX.\nThe claimant testified that he feared certain members of the union who were after him because he had denounced some of them as thieves and receivers of stolen property. When confronted with this statement, the claimant declared that he had not denounced anyone, that he could not prove who the thieves were, that he had never seen the members in question stealing, and that some fellow workers had given him names. The panel does not accept these explanations. Why would he be harassed if he does not know anything?\nThe panel finds that the claimant's testimony as a whole is not credible. In this regard, the Federal Court of Appeal ruled as follows in its decision in Sheikh:4\n(...) even without disbelieving every word an applicant has uttered, a (...) panel may reasonably find him so lacking in credibility that it concludes there is no credible evidence relevant to his claim (...) In other words, a general finding of a lack of credibility on the part of the applicant may conceivably extend to all relevant evidence emanating from his testimony.\nIn the present case, even if the panel had believed the story of the refugee protection claimants, it would have found that they both have an internal flight alternative because they would only be harassed in XXXXX, and in the Federal District, they would not have any problems except that of finding employment.\nDELAY IN MAKING A CLAIM\nThe claimant states in his PIF that he got married on XXXXX, 2001, with a view to leaving the country, and that he and his wife only left Mexico on XXXXX, 2002, as the claimant had been dismissed from his employment on XXXXX, 2002. This indicates to the panel that the claimants did not have any subjective fear of persecution in their country. The claimant continued to work, as if there were nothing wrong and without experiencing any problems, after the alleged troubles of the summer of 2001, until XXXXX, 2002. On page 4 of the port-of-entry notes, the claimant stated that he did not claim refugee status upon arriving at Dorval on April 27, 2002 because he had no idea of how to go about making a claim, and he was afraid of being sent back. This second delay of 18 days in making a claim after the claimant had arrived here in Canada again indicates to the panel that the refugee protection claimants had no subjective fear of persecution in Mexico.\nCONCLUSION\nIn light of the above analysis, the panel determines that the refugee protection claimants, Mr. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and Ms. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, are neither \"Convention refugees\" nor \"persons in need of protection\" under section 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and therefore rejects their refugee protection claim.\nFurthermore, the panel determines that their claim has no credible basis pursuant to section 107(2) of the Act.\nJean-Marie Chastenay\nJean-Marie Chastenay\nJanuary 16, 2003\nDate\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - PARTICULAR SOCIAL GROUP - CREDIBILITY - DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION RULES - MALE - FEMALE - NEGATIVE - MEXICO\n1 \"96.

Medical documentation was provided for the third sitting, which was peremptory. At that hearing, the claimant acknowledged that the conclusions of exhibit M-11 were correct - that the National Identity Card, seized by CIC, of the claimant was fraudulent. The claimant went on to indicate that the basis of his claim, religion, was false, that his narrative had no basis in fact and that he had used a false name - XXXXXXXX. Indicating that his real name was XXXXXXXXXX, the claimant went to indicate that the basis of his claim was particular social group (homosexuality), that he had been in the United States since XXXX 2001 and not XXXX 2002 as indicated in question 31 of his Personal Information Form (PIF). Given that these clarifications were being presented to the panel subsequent to the submission of exhibit M-1, given the absence of identity documents, given the absence of a credible narrative and given the fact of the claimant having misled counsel, it was reasonable to render a decision on the basis of the case before the panel. Given, however, the new nexus of particular social group and given that the claimant had acknowledged the reality of his claim, the panel concluded the fact of this acknowledgment coming subsequent to exhibit M-1 notwithstanding, that a fourth sitting would not be inappropriate. In this regard, crystal clear directions were given to the claimant and counsel with regard to a fourth sitting which would be peremptory.\nThe claimant was instructed to bring originals of his passport, education documents and \"B\" form to the hearing. The claimant was also instructed to submit a new narrative to the panel, based upon his new claim, within two weeks or by July 7, 2003.\nAt the fourth sitting, the original passport was not available. What had been deposited was a photocopy of the first six pages of the claimant's alleged passport which does not allow for a full and complete assessment of the document. When questioned as to why the directive from the previous sitting had not been followed, the claimant's explanation was that his friend in New York city was afraid to send it by mail because \"U.S. INS must see the return address, seize the passport and put the claimant's friend at risk\". In that, this is an extraordinary implausible explanation, in that, the claimant did not seek counsel's advice on this issue and in that, he did not return her numerous phone calls attempting to contact him and in that, his explanation in this regard was that he would be embarrassed because she would inevitably ask him where was the passport. The panel concludes that the claimant has failed in his burden as elucidated in section 106 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\nWith regard to the requirement for submission of original education documents, the claimant alleges to have asked his father to mail the originals. These originals have not been received. The claimant has provided a photocopy of a courier receipt indicating that a package was sent to Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) on June 27, 2003. The panel has no way of verifying the contents of that package and, contrary to standard operating procedure, has received no notice of seizure from CIC. The claimant made no effort to follow-up regarding these documents with CIC and neither sought advice from, informed or returned calls from counsel regarding this issue.\nWith regards to the requirement of a new narrative, a document which the claimant needed to rely on no one other than himself, the claimant has failed, over a period of three months, to reach the original two week delay requested by the panel for submission of such a document. When asked why he had failed to do so, the claimant testified \"how could I submit a narrative if my identity is not established\". Given that the claimant failed to show due diligence in establishing his identity for the fourth sitting, given that he was given such opportunity subsequent to the submission of exhibit M-1 and the consequent exposure of the false basis of his claim and identity in the first place, the panel finds this circular reasoning and explanation patently unreasonable.\nWhen asked, under Rule 58 (2) (a), why his claim should not be declared abandoned, the claimant repeated his assertion that the passport would arrive in a few days. The panel recognizes that photocopies of documentation have been submitted. Given, however, the significant initial fabrications exposed subsequent to exhibit M-1, given the consequent crystal clear directives to provide originals of said documents, given that the claimant had more than ample time to do so over a three month period in the context of a significant effort by the panel to give him every opportunity in a fourth sitting to present his claim, given that he made no effort to contact counsel regarding documents, given that he did not respond to counsel's efforts to contact him in that regard, given that he failed to provide a narrative or corrections to the original PIF that would explain a new basis of his claim and enable a fair assessment and given that, therefore, that would be no reasonable basis upon which to assess testimony at this fourth sitting, the panel concludes as per Section 168 of the IRPA, the applicant is in default of proceedings, in particular by feeling to provide information required by the Division, when he was given generous and ample opportunity to do so and when it was patently reasonable that he should have been able to do so.\nBased on the above facts and analysis, the panel concludes that the claimant's claim has been abandoned.\nMichael Crelinsten\nMichael Crelinsten\nNovember 5th, 2003\nDate\n\/ez\n1 Exhibit M-1 - Copy of Rapport d'examen, concerning Carte d'identit\u00e9 Nationale du Pakistan no.

She alleges that she has a well-founded fear of persecution in Iran by reason of her membership in a particular social group, namely, women who are victims of domestic violence.\nEVIDENCE\nThe evidence adduced by the claimant (Exhibits P-1 to P-12), her counsel and the refugee protection officer (RPO) who did not attend the hearing (Exhibits A-1 to A-32) essentially consists of the Personal Information Form (PIF) and documents relating to the socio-political situation in Iran.\nIDENTITY\nThe identity of the refugee protection claimant was established to the panel's satisfaction. The claimant travelled with her Iranian passport.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant fears her husband, to whom she has been married since 1952, when she was only 13 years old; her husband is 9 years older than she is. The many episodes of domestic violence began a few years later, when she was 16 or 17. After her parents died, the violence endured by the claimant worsened.\nDuring the war between Iran and Iraq, one of the claimant's sons was killed, and the other son was taken prisoner by the Iraqis. Because of these misfortunes, the claimant's husband turned to drugs, namely, opium, and the claimant's situation became increasingly difficult. Despite their sympathy for their mother, the claimant's children urged her to reconcile with their father, her husband. The violence increased. She was hit with a stick and a metal bar. The claimant reported these incidents to the police, but they did not lay charges. On the contrary, they lectured her about obeying her husband and told her that she was responsible for the incidents, since she must have provoked him.\nThe claimant tried unsuccessfully to obtain a divorce. The court refused, since her husband had apparently bribed the family court judge with the gift of a Persian rug.\nWith the help of her daughter who lives in Australia, the claimant left Iran on XXXXX, 2001. She lived with her daughter until XXXX, 2002, when she realized that her son-in-law did not like the idea of her staying there any longer because of her difficulties in Iran.\nUpon arriving in Canada legally on April 19, 2002, she lived with her brother, who has been a Canadian citizen for over 20 years. She claimed refugee protection on May 17, 2002, after realizing that she had no choice, since she no longer wanted to return to live with her husband.\nANALYSIS\nThe panel is of the opinion that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is a \"Convention refugee\" by reason of her membership in a particular social group, women who are victims of domestic violence. The panel took into consideration the guidelines issued by the Chairperson in 1993 regarding women who are victims of violence: \"Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.\"\nThe claimant, who is 64 years old, gave direct and spontaneous testimony that was generally in agreement with her written testimony.\nThe panel noted some discrepancies regarding certain dates as well as the chronology of a few of the incidents described in her written testimony. All things considered, the panel finds that such errors are normal when one is asked to relate incidents dating back, in some cases, 50 years. The panel finds that the claimant spoke truthfully when she stated that she was a victim of domestic violence. Furthermore, her behaviour was consistent with that of women or individuals in similar situations, in that she continually hoped that her husband would stop turning to violence. The claimant testified that her brother, who lives in Montreal, had even advised her to return to Iran and had told her that it was her duty to be with her husband. It was not until he finally understood her true situation that he agreed to take her in.\nThe facts demonstrate that, since the very beginning of her marriage, the claimant has been the victim of violence by her husband, violence that increased over the years. Furthermore, the panel agrees that, in hoping that the violence would end, the claimant had come to adopt the behaviour unfortunately found all too often among battered women. In Iran, this situation is aggravated by the position of women in society, which makes it very difficult to obtain protection from the State, or even from non-profit non-governmental organizations.\nThe documentary evidence on Iran reveals that it has always been practically impossible for women to obtain protection when they are victims of spousal violence. It is useful to refer to excerpts from this documentary evidence:\nExhibit P-1, \"Human Rights Brief: Women in the Islamic Republic of Iran,\" DIRB IRB, April 1994, pp. 22-23:\n[TRANSLATION]\nMassomeh Namavar, associate professor of counselling psychology at Cambridge College in Massachusetts, points out that women are very reluctant to reveal their difficulties; however, she believes that approximately 70% of women are victims of some form of physical or psychological domestic violence (4 November 1993).\nAfkhami and Najmabadi acknowledge that women have very few options in such situations: there are no shelters for women who are victims of violence, and violence is considered the husband's prerogative (Afkhami, 3 November 1993; Najmabadi, 3 November 1993). Moreover, a woman who leaves her husband receives no social support (Namavar, 4 November 1993). She can return to her family, but social norms discourage this. (Afkhami, 3 November 1993).\nIn Exhibit P-2, Response to Information Request IRN23787.E, April 22, 1996:\nDivorced or widowed women are treated by men as second-hand objects. Getting divorced or becoming a widow is a shame on the woman and her parental family. That is why women have to tolerate their husbands under all conditions. If they get divorced they have to live with their parents because they cannot find a job and live an independent life. As 'second-hand' females, they have a slight chance for re-marrying.\nIn Exhibit A-11, Response to Information Request IRN29616, July 2, 1998:\nThe following information on police intervention in cases of domestic abuse was provided to the Research Directorate by a professor of sociology at Concordia University in Montreal, who specializes in women's issues in Iran. If a woman who is being beaten by her husband calls the police from her home, it is unlikely that they would intervene; however, the woman has the option of going to the police station to lodge a complaint against her husband. If a woman chooses that option, she must produce a medical certificate proving that she has received a serious physical injury (e.g. a broken bone or knife-wound) at the hands of her husband before the police will open a file on the case. Moreover, the professor is not aware of any instance in which the police have opened a file after the first certified instance of physical injury at the hands of a husband. However, the professor believes that the police will usually open a file if a woman produces a certificate of serious injury for a second or third time (26 June 1998).\nClearly, it may be readily concluded from this evidence that the claimant has discharged the burden of proof on her to establish that she is a victim of domestic violence within the meaning of the Convention.\nCONCLUSION\nConsequently, I determine that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is a \"Convention refugee.\" 1\nJacques W. Fortier\nJacques W. Fortier\nJanuary 8, 2003\nDate\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, reads in part as follows:\n\"96.

She also alleges to be a \"person in need of protection\", because she faces a risk to her life and a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nThe evidence in this case consisted essentially of the claimant's testimony, her Personal Information Form (PIF), her personal documents, and the documentary evidence concerning the social and political situation in Uganda.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant is a 23-year old single woman. She alleges that her father is from the XXXX tribe from Mbale South, the area bordering with Kenya. According to the claimant, her father's tribe is related to the XXXXXX tribe of Kapichorwa, who still performs FGM.\nDespite the fact that the claimant's mother separated from her husband when the claimant was a baby, according to the tribal tradition, the children belong to the father's tribe. That is why the claimant's father and his family insisted that the claimant and her two sisters be circumcised. The claimant's mother and herself opposed the practice. However, as the claimant grew up, the pressure from her father and his family became stronger.\nThe claimant was obliged to leave her mother's home and go to live with her aunt in XXXXX. However, the pressure from her father did not cease. On the contrary, in XXXXX 2001, the claimant's mother was attacked and brutally beaten, and in XXXX 2002, the claimant's aunt, with whom she was living in XXXXX, was killed.\nAfraid for her life, the claimant started hiding with another relative. However, she was afraid that her father would find her and forcibly submit her to FGM. With the help of her mother, the claimant fled Uganda. She came to Canada on May 5, 2002, and on May 10, she asked for asylum.\nShould she go back to Uganda, the claimant is afraid that her father would force her to undergo FGM, or that, if she keeps refusing, he would kill her.\nDETERMINATION\nAfter examining the claimant's written and oral testimonies, as well as all the evidence adduced in this case, I have come to the conclusion that the claimant is a \"Convention refugee\",1 for the reasons which follow.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\nIn order to establish her identity, the claimant submitted her birth certificate (Exhibit P-2), a transcript of notes from the XXXX University in XXXXX (Exhibit P-4), and a Staff Identification Card (with her photo) from the company where she worked in XXXXXX (Exhibit A-18). The claimant was extensively questioned about these documents. She explained in a credible way how she had obtained her birth certificate and school certificates, and why she had carried her work ID with her when she came to Canada.\nThere were some problems with the inscription in her birth certificate, concerning her father's place of residence. I have accepted the claimant's testimony as plausible, that when the document was issued, in 2002, the father's place of residence and his profession were written as they were stated in the hospital certificate at the time of the claimant's birth, and not as they were at the time of the issuing of the birth certificate, in 2002.\nBased on the evidence on hand, I have accepted, on the balance of probabilities, that the claimant has established her identity.\nCredibility\nIn evaluating this claim, I took into consideration the Chairperson's Guidelines concerning gender-related claims.\nThroughout the hearing, the claimant presented in general a genuine and straightforward testimony. There were no apparent contradictions between her oral testimony and her written narrative, as well as her declarations made during an interview with an immigration officer.2 The claimant was by moments emotional, she cried while talking about the death of her older sister and her aunt.\nThere were some omissions in her PIF, like for example the fact that prior to the assassination of her aunt, her father had come to XXXXX and threatened her aunt. Also, the claimant did not write in her PIF that following her aunt's death, her mother's family was afraid to keep her.\nHowever, I have accepted the claimant's explanations for these omissions. Concerning the threats to her aunt, it was mentioned in the claimant's written narrative, in a more general way, that her father had threatened her aunt and quarrelled with her on several occasions. As for her omitting to write that her mother's family was afraid to keep her, I have given the claimant the benefit of the doubt and accepted her explanation, that she had written about it in her PIF in a more general way, mentioning that she did not have a safe place to stay in Uganda, without being exposed to a danger from her father.\nSince the claimant was not persecuted by the state, the issue of Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) was discussed during the hearing. I have accepted as plausible the claimant's explanations, that after her aunt's death, her mother's family was afraid to give her a long-term shelter, and that as a young female, the claimant could not live safely alone in her country. I have accepted this argument as reasonable.\nForced FGM is considered as persecution by the Canadian jurisprudence. The claimant submitted a medical certificate from a doctor in Montreal (Exhibit P-9), attesting that she was not circumcised.\nIn the documentary evidence submitted by the Refugee Protection Officer (RPO) (Exhibits A-5 and A-19 to A-23), it is indicated that FGM is not widely practised in Uganda. It is still practised by the Sabiny tribe in the Kapichorwa region, and to a lesser extent in a few other regions. FGM is also still practised by the Pokot tribe. The claimant's father's tribe, XXXX, is not directly mentioned in the documentary evidence.\nAccording to the British Assessment,3 there are more than 40 African ethnic groups living in Uganda. It quotes the names of the major groups. Neither the Sabiny tribe nor Bayobo tribe are specifically mentioned in that chapter. However, it is documented that the Sabiny tribe is living in Uganda and is practising FGM. I believe that it is plausible that other small tribes, originating from Kenya and related to the Sabiny tribe, are also still practising FGM in Uganda, although they are not specifically mentioned in the documentary evidence.\nIt is clear that the Ugandan government and international organisations operating in Uganda deploy important educational efforts in order to discourage the practice of FGM. However, while being discouraged, the practice of FGM in Uganda is not outlawed and can still be performed legally.\nFaced with a credible testimony presented by the claimant and with the documentary evidence, which reports that FGM is still practised in Uganda by some tribes, I decided to give the claimant the benefit of the doubt and to accept that she has a reasonable risk of persecution by her father and his family, should she go back to Uganda.\nDECISION\nConsidering the fact that the claimant has established her identity, that she has presented a generally credible testimony, and that the alleged facts are plausible in the light of the documentary evidence, I conclude that Miss XXXXXXXXXXXXX has established a well-founded fear of persecution in Uganda, and therefore she is a \"Convention refugee\", as per Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nBarbara Berger\nBarbara Berger\nJanuary 3, 2003\nDate\n\/jcbo\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. (2001), chap. 27, provides the following definition :\n\" 96.

They claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution in the mother's country of origin, in the mother's case, by reason of her membership in a particular social group, that of female victims of conjugal violence in Peru, and in the case of the children, by reason of their membership in the particular social group of the family.\nThe mother further alleges that she would be subject personally to a risk to her life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment should she have to return to Peru. The refugee protection claims of the minor children, duly represented by their mother, are based on the same facts that she has alleged.\nALLEGED FACTS\nThe evidence in this case was submitted by the claimants, their counsel and the refugee protection officer (RPO). The evidence consisted of the following: the claimants' Personal Information Forms (PIFs), the mother's oral testimony, the claimants' identity documents, personal papers and documents on the socio-political and human rights situation in Peru. The panel also considered the Canadian guidelines, Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution (updated in 1996). The claimants' PIFs and the mother's oral testimony revealed the following facts:\nThe mother, the principal claimant, was born and apparently lived most of her life in Piura, a town of some 36,000 inhabitants located in northern Peru, near the border with Ecuador. In her PIF, she said she had had about 10 years of schooling. She held three jobs from 1995 to 1999.\nThe mother testified that she had lived with two different men in a conjugal relationship, with the result that she became the mother of the two children who are also claimants in this case. While separated but not divorced from her first spouse, she said she had lived with a man named XXXXXXXX from XXXXXXX 1998 until XXXXXX, 2002, at which time they separated. She said she has not seen him since.\nThe mother has essentially based her refugee protection claim on the alleged fact that beginning in XXXXXXXX 2001 she became the victim of a number of instances of violence as well as an attempted rape by her former common-law spouse, XXXXXXXXXX, whose alcoholism became worse over time. Mr. XXXXX came from a [translation] \"rich\" family and had [translation] \"close ties\" with certain key figures in police, legal and political circles, including an uncle she said was XXXXXXXXXX in the Paniagua administration.\nThe mother claimed that she filed two complaints at the XXXXXXX police station in the city of XXXX, where she says she lived from 1999 until late XXXXX 2001, before returning to her parents' home in Piura where she ultimately went back to live with XXXXXXX until XXXXX 2002. She said she also filed a complaint at the XXXXXX police station. In each case, the police officers failed to take her complaint seriously and merely had her sign some papers and instructed her to stay calm, without referring her to medical examiners in accordance with the law.\nThe principal claimant submitted in evidence the last complaint she filed in Piura and stated that neither she nor her counsel was able to obtain copies of the two complaints she had filed in Lima. Due to this \"lack of evidence\", she said, her lawyer decided not to bring an action against XXXXXXXXX. The principal claimant also said that she went on XXXXX, 2002 to the youth protection office in XXXXX where, she said, the lawyer in the office told her that little could be done about her problem of conjugal violence and that, in any event, the legal process for obtaining justice would [translation] \"cost her a great deal of money\" and take [translation] \"a very long time.\"\nFollowing the assault of XXXXX, 2002, in the course of which XXXXX allegedly attempted to rape her in front of her children and \"brutally\" struck her, the principal claimant said she was taken by ambulance to the XXXXX XXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX, where she said she was hospitalized and treated from XXXXXX to X, 2002 [translation] \"for a head injury and multiple contusions on her body\", as stated in a medical certificate produced as Exhibit P-4. When she left the medical centre, she went into hiding with her children at the home of friends of her parents in Piura.\nAlready in possession of passports and American visas obtained in view of a planned trip to Miami (USA) in early January 2002 that had ultimately been dropped, the claimants reached Ecuador by road on XXXXXX, 2002, accompanied by the mother's parents and sister. All of these individuals caught a flight from Ecuador the same day and landed the next day in the United States, where they remained for a week without requesting protection from the authorities. They all finally reached the Canadian border at Lacolle, where they immediately stated their intention to claim refugee status.\nOn March 5, 2003, this panel heard the refugee protection claims of the principal claimant's parents and sister and rendered a negative decision two days later. An application for leave and for judicial review is currently pending in the Federal Court.\nThe principal claimant said she is afraid of returning to Peru, for herself and for her children, because there they will continue to be targeted by XXXXXXXXXXXXX. Since the principal claimant left Peru, Mr. XXXXX has allegedly attempted to find out where she is on three occasions by appearing at the homes of some of her family members and friends. The last attempt of this kind took place on February 14, 2003. The principal claimant believes that authorities, agencies and lawyers she consulted have proved themselves unable to assist her.\nThese, then, are the essential facts that were recounted to the panel by the mother, the only person to have testified in this case. The panel must decide whether she is a \"Convention refugee\"1 and\/or a \"person in need of protection\"2 as defined in sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nANALYSIS\nBased on a detailed analysis of all the evidence submitted, both the testimony and the documents, the panel finds that the claimants have discharged the burden that rested on them of demonstrating that they have a well-founded fear of persecution in Peru. The panel has come to this conclusion for the following reasons:\nBefore proceeding any further, the panel informed the principal claimant at the start of the hearing that it had heard and rejected the refugee protection claims of her parents and her sister in March 2003. It also made it clear to her that it was not bound by this decision, that each refugee protection claim is considered on its own merits and that the refugee protection claims of her and of her children were based on facts different from those alleged by her parents and sister.\nThat said, the panel has had the opportunity to observe the behaviour of the principal claimant and to note that she testified with a degree of sadness and emotion that appeared genuine, although she spoke rather slowly and the RPO constantly had to prompt her to provide details when describing her problems. The panel did not detect any contradictions or discrepancies between her oral testimony and the narrative in her PIF.\nIt is true that the claimant failed to mention in the narrative of her PIF that she had spoken with lawyer XXXXXXXXXX and that the lawyer had made efforts to obtain copies of the complaints filed in Lima. She explained that she did not think it [translation]\"was important\" to mention this in the PIF. However, she did file a statement from the lawyer as Exhibit P-10.\nAt first sight, it appears implausible that the claimant would not have been able to receive some semblance of assistance from the police forces with which she said she filed complaints on three occasions, particularly in view of the obligations imposed on them under the Family Violence Law, adopted in 1993 and subsequently strengthened. However, the panel cannot ignore the findings of two Human Rights Watch (HRW) teams during their visits to Peru in November 1996 and December 1999, to look into the application of the principles embodied in the legislation.\nDuring their visits, the HRW investigators met with defenders of women's rights, community activists, staff members of shelters for victims of conjugal violence, social workers and lawyers in private practice. They also interviewed officials from Peru's national police force, from the institute of forensic medicine, from the office of the public prosecutor and from the office of the defender of the people and the judiciary. Twenty-five Peruvian victims of conjugal violence in Lima and in the country's rural sectors also gave testimony. The following significant passages appear under the heading of \"Police Procedures\":\nThe Family Violence Law stipulates that the police have the duty to investigate all reported cases of conjugal violence, regardless of whether the victim pursues the charges and, at the request of the victim, can provide guarantees (protection) to safeguard her integrity. [. . .]\nBecause filing a complaint with the police is the principal and first avenue for gaining access to the justice system, barriers at this stage can, and often do, deny women's access to redress. Human Rights Watch documented troubling deficiencies in the performance of the police. These include mistreatment of women filing complaints, inadequate investigations, unnecessary delays, and practices that jeopardize women's safety and physical and psychological integrity.\nVirtually every case we investigated involved initial police rejection of the complaint. The women interviewed said they encountered incredulity and abusive treatment when they attempt to report violence in their interpersonal relationships. This is particularly true for women reporting intimate partner rape. [. . .]\nHuman Rights Watch makes the following recommendations to the Commission: [. . .]\nEnsure that the National Police institute disciplinary measures or, if relevant, criminal proceedings against those police officers who refuse complaints, fail to act promptly, or mistreat victims.3\nIn view of this information and in consideration of the foregoing information, it would seem reasonable to give the principal claimant the benefit of the doubt regarding the possibility that she was the victim of conjugal violence and in particular, that the police did not take her complaints seriously.\nThe issue now arises of whether the Peruvian authorities are able to ensure the application of the positive measures set out in the Family Violence Law. The documentary evidence refers to the establishment of 12 \"women's police stations\" since the 1980s, nine \"one-step centers for victims of conjugal violence\" in which since March 1999 the women in question have been able to find under one roof police officers, forensic medical examiners and public prosecutors, not to mention the \"Municipal Defender's Offices (Demunas)\" and the vital efforts being made by the non-government community involved in defending women's rights.\nAccording to various independent sources, serious problems persist in Peru. Consequently, in practice many female victims of conjugal violence still do not receive even a minimum of the protection provided for under the law, as the following significant excerpts reveal:\nViolence against women, including rape, spousal abuse, and sexual, physical, and mental abuse of women and girls was a chronic problem. Such abuses were aggravated by insensitivity on the part of law enforcement and judicial authorities toward the female victims. [. . .] Although official figures for the number of arrests and convictions in abuse cases were unavailable, NGO sources contended that the majority of reported cases did not result in formal charges due to fear of retaliation from the accused spouse, or because of the cost involved in pursuing a complaint. In addition, legal and physical protection was limited by delays in legal processes, ambiguities in the law, and lack of alternative shelter and income for victims.4\nCountries as diverse as Pakistan, South Africa, Jordan, Russia, Uzbekistan, and Peru have one thing in common: horrendous records on addressing domestic violence. [. . .] In Peru, despite improvements in its domestic violence legislation, the law still does not protect women from marital rape and stalking. Discriminatory attitudes of law enforcement officials, prosecutors, and judges, who often consider domestic violence a \"private\" matter beyond the reach of the law, reinforce the batterer's attempts to demean and control his victim.5\nImplementation in practice of the Family Violence Law is also seriously inadequate. From the very moment that they do so, those women who attempt to lodge a domestic violence complaint face a justice system which appears fraught with bias and incapable of affording them effective remedy or redress. Police are unresponsive and ineffectual; medical examinations by forensic doctors are frequently cursory and inadequate, tending to minimize injuries women have sustained through domestic violence; and state prosecutors and judges often appear to consider domestic violence insufficiently serious to warrant prosecuting and punishing the perpetrators. As a result, in practice women are afforded inadequate protection against domestic violence by the state, and this, in turn, serves only to deter women from making complaints and to mask the full extent of the problem.6\nThe implementation and effectiveness of the Law on Family Violence is limited in that while it allows the police to enter a household where domestic violence is taking place, in practice this type of police intervention has never taken place. The lawyer blames this lack of response to either police ignorance of their role in such situations or their belief that such issues belong to the private sphere. The law is further limited by the lack of trained staff and financial resources to effectively implement it. Medical and police staff need to be further educated on the law. Although there are services and shelters for victims of family violence, these are inadequate to address the seriousness of the problem.\nGiven the rigidity and demanding emphasis on proof, and primarily physical proof, and the length of time it takes to process cases, many victims of violence abandon their cases before a Family Judge (Juzgado de Familia) can issue any protection measures. Abandonment can be attributed to a woman's economic or emotional dependence on her spouse or partner.7\nThese non-exhaustive quotations are, in the panel's opinion, amply sufficient for it to reasonably conclude that the Peruvian authorities are still unable to provide adequate protection to all female victims of conjugal violence. The panel therefore finds that the claimant's fears of once again becoming a victim of conjugal violence in Peru are well founded.\nThe cannot ignore the fact that Peru's political situation has been improving since the sudden departure of former president Alberto Fujimori in November 2000 and the inauguration in July 2001 of the current president, Alejandro Toledo, whose popularity has, however, plunged substantially in the past few months. It is true that the provisional administration of President Valentin Paniagua did result in the adoption of certain HRW recommendations by Peru's congress:\nIn 2000 Human Rights Watch called on the Government to improve legislation on domestic violence by eliminating mandatory reconciliation sessions between victims and abusers, and by providing law enforcement and social providers with training to improve their sensitivity to victims' needs. In January 2001, Congress approved a law that states that reconciliation sessions between the abuser and victim are not required in cases of domestic violence. A 2000 law expanded the definition of domestic violence to include sexual violence, and to include all intimate partners whether or not the victim and perpetrator had ever lived together.8\nIt seems premature, however, to conclude that the change of circumstances means that victims of conjugal violence now receive adequate protection in Peru. It will undoubtedly take a certain amount of time for independent organizations to ensure in the field that the provisions of, and recent enhancements to, these laws are truly effective.\nBefore concluding, it should be noted that the identity documents submitted in evidence by the claimants are acceptable and that the panel has no doubts concerning this matter.\nCONCLUSION\nThe evidence on the most important elements of the refugee protection claims under consideration have been found sufficient to establish that the claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution should they return to Peru. For that reason, the panel determines that the claimants, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, and her children, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, are \"Convention refugees\" and their refugee protection claims are accepted.\nCharles DeBlois\nCharles DeBlois\nMay 12, 2003\nDate\n1 \"96.

The claimant is currently 55 years old. He stated that he is a citizen of India, a country he allegedly left on June 4, 2002 to come to Canada.\nHe made a claim for refugee protection with two components. First, he stated that he has a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group and political opinion. He also claimed to be a \"person in need of protection\" on the basis that he would be subject to a danger of torture, a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if he returned to his country.\nSUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant alleged the following in support of his claim.\nHe is a citizen of India but is of Sikh nationality and religion. In his country, he lived in Jalandhar District in Punjab State. After leaving school in 1962, he began working on the family farm. His brother, XXXXXXXXXXXX, became a member of the Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar) party in 1996.\nOn XXXXX, 1999, three terrorists came to take refuge at the home of the claimant's family, leaving weapons there which they returned to pick up the next day.\nOn XXXXXXX, 1999, the police raided his home to arrest him and his brother. He was questioned about his dealings with Kuljit Singh and his militants. He was shown a photograph of a young Sikh man in poor condition, whom he identified as being among those who had come to his home. He was tortured and released after two days thanks to the intervention of a municipal councillor and some important individuals from the area and the payment of a bribe.\nOn XXXXXXX, 2000, there was an explosion in the village of XXXX a few kilometres away from the claimant's farm. The next day, the police raided the farm and arrested him and his brother, accusing them of knowing the terrorists involved in the explosion. He was then tortured so that he would make admissions. He was released the same day thanks to the intervention of the town council and the payment of a bribe.\nOn XXXXXXXX, 2002, while he and his brother XXXXX were on their way to deliver goods to XXXXXXXX, some terrorists stopped them at gunpoint and forced them to hand over their truck. On the evening of XXXXXXXXX, 2002, the police raided the family farm and questioned them about their involvement in terrorist activities. They were accused of transporting weapons and ammunition for the terrorists. The claimant's photograph and fingerprints were taken, and he was forced to sign a blank document. He was released three days later, again through the intervention of the municipal council and the payment of a bribe. He was released on condition that he help the police arrest XXXXXXXXXXXXX and the other terrorists. He was supposed to report to the police station one month later to provide information about them. After being treated, he was afraid of the police and the terrorists; he decided to leave the village, which he did on XXXXXXX, 2002, when he went to the home of his friend XXXXXXXXX in XXXXXXXXXX, New Delhi. A friend of XXXXXXXXXXX introduced him to a facilitator, who took care of getting him out of India. He left on XXXXX, 2002.\nDECISION\nAfter reviewing all the testimony and documentary evidence, the panel has concluded that the claimant is neither a \"Convention refugee\"1 nor a \"person in need of protection\".2\nANALYSIS\nCredibility and basis of the claim\nHis claim raises both identity and credibility problems. Since these two points are closely related in some ways, they will be looked at together.\nIn Maldonaldo,3 the Federal Court stated that sworn testimony is presumed to be true unless there are valid reasons to doubt its truthfulness. In this case, I think that there are several reasons to doubt the claimant's credibility and identity, as the following examples show.\nIdentity\nTo begin with, as regards the claimant's date of birth, both his testimony and the photocopy of a passport4 he allegedly received from India after arriving in Canada indicate that he was born on XXXXXX, 1948. Yet two other documents, namely his birth certificate5 and his driver's licence,6 indicate instead that he was born on XXXXXX, 1948. When confronted with these facts, the claimant said that he had indeed been born on XXXXXX, 1948 but that, in his country, dates are sometimes shown with the month before the day. He therefore questioned the date of XXXXXX, 1948 shown on the latter two documents referred to. However, his explanation does not hold up, since, on his driver's licence, which indicates that he was born on XXXXX, 1948, there are other reference dates, such as the validity period of the licence, namely XXXX\/1994 to XXX\/2004, and in such a case, it can be said without a shadow of a doubt that the first number, XXX, represents the day, since it cannot represent the month, and that the XX represents the month. This confirms that the use of XXX\/1948 clearly indicates that the claimant was born on XXXXX, 1948.\nWhen this was pointed out to him, he then got in a muddle with his attempts to explain, which clarified nothing. At one point, his counsel asked him what he was relying on in saying he had been born in XXXX, and he stated that he was relying on his school certificate.7 However, this document was not issued until 2003 and has two issue dates on it: XXX\/2003 at the top and XXX\/2003 at the bottom. The claimant did not provide a satisfactory explanation for this. I attach no probative value either to the claimant's testimony on this point or to the documents he submitted. I find that he has not proved his date of birth.\nIncidentally, it is worth noting that the passport of which the claimant filed a photocopy, and which he said is his real passport, was filed at the hearing. This made the panel wonder about the source of this document, which was allegedly issued on XXXXX, 2001. This is contrary to the answers he provided when he filled out his Personal Information Form (PIF), especially his answers to questions 24 and 27. As can be seen under question 24, when he signed the PIF on July 29, 2002, he put down \"N\/A\" when asked to list the passports or travel documents he had obtained in any country over the past 20 years. Moreover, question 27 asks: \"If you did not obtain a passport or travel document, explain why\". His answer was: \"I never needed a passport or a travel document\". When questioned about this, he again became muddled up in a series of explanations and provided none that was satisfactory.\nIn his PIF, the claimant also stated that he had been arrested several times with his brother and that he had been released following the last arrest on XXXX, 2002 but that his brother had never been released. Thus, under question 15 of his PIF, where he listed the members of his family and the place and country where they were, he wrote that he did not know where his brother was. This does not correspond to what is stated on this point in Exhibit P-6 filed by the claimant. It is a declaration signed by the president of the transport truck owners' association, and it instead states: \". . . his brother XXXXXXXXXX was disappeared by the police\". The claimant could not provide a satisfactory explanation for this.\nMoreover, in support of his story, he filed Exhibit P-4, an affidavit allegedly signed on January 10, 2003 by a municipal councillor from his village, XXXXXXXXXXX. However, the name on the stamp at the bottom of the document is Tekhar, which is not the same as the name at the start of the document. When asked about this, the claimant merely repeated that the municipal councillor was named \"XXXXX\" and that, if \"XXXXX\" had been written, it was a mistake. The panel cannot accept this explanation, since the name \"XXXXX\" is on the very stamp used by the municipal councillor. One would imagine that, if he was named \"XXXXX\" rather than \"XXXXXX\", that name would be on the stamp. I attach no probative value to this document, especially since it is based on the claimant's story, to which I give no credence.\nBesides these specific points, however, it is the claimant's story as a whole that I question given that it contradicts the documentation. His story is based on the problems he allegedly had with the terrorists and the police, who arrested and tortured him. However, according to the documentation,8 there is no longer any militancy in Punjab.\nNext, the claimant alleged had he had been arrested by the police and accused of helping the terrorists by transporting weapons and ammunition for them. I find these allegations quite simply implausible. If the police had arrested him and accused him of transporting weapons and ammunition for the terrorists, it is not unreasonable to think that they would not have released him and would at least have formally charged him and brought him to court. I do not believe the claimant's story at all, and it strikes me as having been invented for the purposes of his claim for refugee protection.\nThe claimant also filed several doctor's letters,9 to which I attach no probative value, since they are all based on his story, which I have already said is not credible. Moreover, it must be specifically noted that one of these letters,10 the one dated May 21, 2003, states that the claimant has had memory problems since XXXX 2002 as a result, he said, of electric shocks being administered to his head while he was detained. Yet when the refugee protection officer (RPO) questioned him about the interview he had had with an immigration officer on July 4, 2002 for the consideration of his claim for refugee protection, he stressed that he remembered very clearly how everything had happened. When the RPO confronted him about the fact that Exhibit P-12 indicates that he has been complaining of memory problems since XXXXX 2002, he explained that his memory problems are sporadic. However, it was evident that he had made up this answer to get himself out of a predicament.\nMoreover, as regards his memory problems, in his PIF, and particularly his answer to question 41, he explained in a well-written text all the problems he had allegedly had, with details about the circumstances, locations and dates. As already noted, he contradicted the information he gave the doctor about his memory problems.\nThis being said, the panel finds that the claimant has failed to prove that there is a reasonable chance he would be persecuted if he returned to his country. Moreover, in view of the problems with the claimant's identity and lack of credibility, I also find that there are no substantial grounds warranting the application of paragraphs 97(1)(a) and (b) of the Act.\nIt should also be noted that, although the panel decided to dismiss an objection by the claimant's counsel to the questions the RPO was asking the claimant about an immigration officer's report concerning an interview the officer had had with the claimant in connection with his claim for refugee protection, the panel nonetheless left it open to the claimant to make a motion to summon the officer if he wanted to have him come and testify about a specific point in his report. The claimant did in fact do so before the hearing ended, and the panel reserved everything for decision.\nThe problem is that, at the start of the hearing, the claimant had submitted Exhibit P-17, a passport in his name that he testified had been issued on XXXXXX, 2001, while he was still in his country. The RPO pointed out to him that he had answered question 7 in the officer's report by saying he had no passport and that a little further on, under question 9, it seemed clear that he had no documents apart from his birth certificate and driver's licence. He then explained that he had answered this way because he had understood that he was being asked whether he had other documents with him in Canada. It was thus on this point that his counsel wanted the immigration officer to come and testify.\nThe panel refused the request for a summons, since the claimant did not deny either the question asked of him or the answer he had given. All he said was that, when he had answered that way, he had thought he was being asked whether he had other documents with him in Canada. This is therefore a point on which the immigration officer cannot testify, since he cannot express an opinion on what the claimant might have thought when he was asked the question. I find that his presence would not be necessary at all in the circumstances, and I therefore refuse the request for a summons.\nDECISION\nAccordingly, the Refugee Protection Division determines that XXXXXXXX is neither a \"Convention refugee\" nor a \"person in need of protection\".\nI therefore reject his claim for refugee protection.\nYves Boisrond\nMe Yves Boisrond\nDecember 15, 2003\nDate\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - IDENTITY - CREDIBILITY - NEGATIVE - INDIA\n1 96.

She alleges that she is a member of a particular social group, namely, battered women in Mexico.\nThe evidence on record consists of the claimant's testimony, as well as the exhibits filed by her counsel as P-13 and P-2.4 The Refugee Protection Officer filed Exhibits A-1 to A-3.\nThe claimant's testimony, as well as her PIF, contained the following facts.\nFACTS\nThe claimant was born on XXXXXXXX, 1977 in XXXXX, a city in the state of Guanajuato, Mexico. She lived with her family until leaving for XXXX in XXXX 2001. She said that, in order to avoid bankruptcy, her father had borrowed money in 1995 from one XXXXXXXX, who had a son named XXXXXXX, and that her family had encouraged her to date Mr. XXXXX because of his good social status.\nThe claimant began dating Mr. XXXX. One evening when she had been drinking, Mr. XXXX raped her in his car before driving her home and threatened her that, if she told her parents, he would see to it that his father exercised his right to assume ownership of her father's house. Moreover, he said that his father had high-level connections with the police and could therefore act with impunity.\nAt her parents' insistence, the claimant continued to date this Mr. XXXX. She testified that he had beaten her often and had sexually abused her, which had affected her physically and psychologically, but that she had not told her parents.\nHaving obtained a passport in 1998 to go to a conference in Florida that did not take place, she tried in 2000 to obtain a visa for the United States, but without success. She also testified that Mr. XXXXX had continually pressured her to marry him, and that she had avoided the issue by saying that she needed to finish her studies before getting married.\nIn XXXXXX 2001, in an effort to solve her problem, the claimant found a job in XXXXX with the help of a friend. She secretly left her city of XXXXXX, in the state of Guanajuato, to go work in XXXXX, unknown to her parents and Mr. XXXXX. However, she said that, on the evening of XXXXXX, 2002, she heard someone knock at the door of her apartment in XXXXX. She opened the door and was surprised to see Mr. XXXX, who hit her violently and shouted at her that there was nowhere for her to hide in Mexico and that he had obtained her address from close friends of his father. He beat her violently on this occasion. The next day, the claimant was forcefully taken back to her parents in XXXX. She went to see a doctor and then told her story to her parents who advised her to hide at the home of one of her cousins. They subsequently arranged for her to leave Mexico. She left on XXXXXX, 2002 and claimed refugee status on July 12, 2002, after filling in the CIC forms on June 16, 2002.\nANALYSIS\nThe panel listened carefully to the claimant's testimony and examined all of the documentary evidence in the file. The panel is satisfied of the identity of the claimant, whose testimony revealed that she had indeed lived in Mexico. Her identity was also established by means of her passport as well as her elector's card, filed by the Refugee Protection Officer as Exhibit A-2,5 and, in the opinion of the panel, these documents are acceptable.\nIn its analysis of the present case, the panel took into consideration the Board's guidelines on women refugee claimants fearing gender-related persecution.\nIn the panel's judgment, although the claimant did not file her claim immediately upon arriving in Canada, but rather waited approximately five or six weeks before doing so, her explanations on this point were reasonable; indeed, the claimant explained that this delay was due to the fact that she had arrived with a group of visitors and that, after inquiring, she had been told that she needed to contact a lawyer, which is what she did as soon as she could.\nThe panel also finds that this delay does not damage the claimant's credibility; this is in line with the case law, in particular Soueidan,6 Mr. Justice Blais, after reviewing the precedents, concluded that:\nThe delay in making a claim is usually only one of many reasons for concluding that a claimant lacks credibility and does not generally, by itself, constitute a sufficient basis for dismissing a claim.\nFurthermore, the claimant's testimony before the panel was sincere. She was not evasive when questioned and always testified in a straightforward, sincere manner. Her testimony in no way contradicted her response to question 37 of her PIF or her statements to immigration officer Jae Won Chung on July 12, 2002.\nBecause of the claimant's consistent and sincere testimony, the panel finds her story credible and beyond doubt. Given that the claimant was credible and claimed refugee protection in Canada as a battered woman, the panel examined the documentary evidence concerning battered women in Mexico. More specifically, it consulted documentation on the situation of women in Mexico, namely, Exhibit A-1,7 section 1.3, as well as sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.6 and 3.10.\nThe above-mentioned documentary evidence reveals that Mexico has laws against domestic violence: the Federal Criminal Code provides sanctions for physical violence against women, as do the laws of the different states, which vary from one state to another but for the most part do not criminalize domestic violence.\nAccording to this same evidence, Mexico is one of the last states where, when a minor is violated, the judge may by law acquit the rapist if he voluntarily marries his victim. This documentary evidence also reveals a very high incidence of domestic and sexual violence in Mexico: it seems that there is violence in one out of three households, that only one out of six households lodges a complaint, and that the domestic violence resource centre provided medical care as well as psychological and legal help to 13,822 victims between January 2001 and July 2001, but only 16 of these cases went to trial.\nThe documentary evidence indicates that, in practice, civil and penal authorities do not generally take legal action in cases of domestic violence unless physical violence is involved, that very often rape and violence against women are not taken seriously, and that judges and prosecutors are frequently indifferent and hostile towards women who report rape.\nThe documentary evidence also points out that, when a woman lodges a complaint under the Federal Criminal Code in order to receive protection, she must retain counsel, and that few complainants have the support or the financial means to hire a lawyer so as to take such action. In addition, with respect to the federal states of Mexico, the complainant must lodge a complaint in the state where she lives in order to obtain justice.\nWhen asked why she did not take advantage of the services offered for her protection by lodging a complaint, the claimant testified that, since Mr. XXXXX was the son of someone who was very influential in the state of Guanajuato and the municipality of XXXXX, the police would not take lodge a complaint against him. This was all the more certain since, according to the documentary evidence, the police very often view domestic violence as a private matter and do not become involved.\nWith respect to an internal flight alternative, the claimant testified that, in XXXXX 2001, she went to work in XXXXX without informing her family or anyone else. She stated that, despite the fact that XXXXX is very far from the city of XXXX and is not in the same state, her persecutor, XXXXX XXXXXX, still found her through friends of his father.\nThe claimant also testified that, both while she was hiding at her cousin's home before coming to Canada and after her arrival in Canada, her parents received anonymous telephone calls telling them that the claimant would be killed if she were found.\nIn light of the claimant's testimony, all the circumstances of the case, the claimant's situation and her persecutor's influence, the panel finds that it was not unreasonable for the claimant not to have sought refuge elsewhere in Mexico.\nThe panel therefore concludes that the evidence provided and all the circumstances of the case are sufficient to establish that, if she returned to her country of origin, Mexico, the claimant would face a reasonable chance of persecution by reason of her membership in a particular social group, namely, battered women.\nCONCLUSION\nConsequently, the panel determines that XXXXXXXXXXXXX is a refugee within the meaning of section 968 of the Act.\nThe claim for refugee protection is accepted.\nMichel Venne\nDate\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - SOCIAL GROUP - WOMEN - VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN - DIRECTIVES ON GENDER-RELATED PERSECUTION - STATE PROTECTION - DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE - INTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE - FEMALE - POSITIVE - MEXICO\n1 Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, reads as follows:\n\"96.

He alleges that he has a well-founded fear of persecution, by Lebanese society in general and by the authorities of his country, by reason of his membership in a particular social group, that is, homosexuals. He also contends that he is a \"person in need of protection,\"1 as he would be subject personally to a danger of torture, to a risk to his life, or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Lebanon.\nThe claimant alleged the following.\nThe claimant stated that he is a non-practising Muslim. He had studied in Lebanon since his early childhood and adolescence. He alleged that he has been the victim of discrimination on numerous occasions because of his homosexuality: he was made fun of, he was beaten up, he was humiliated and no one would befriend him. He finally had to interrupt his studies for one year and see a psychologist for six months in Lebanon. Homosexuality being a disgrace to his family, the claimant likewise did not have the support of any of his family members. After an incident in which a man followed him and made rude gestures, he attempted to make a complaint at a military post, but they did not help him.\nThe claimant came to Canada to study, but he arrived in such a psychological state that he eventually tried to commit suicide. If required to return, the claimant would fear Lebanese society, which does not accept him because of his homosexuality. He fears his family, and he is afraid that he will be beaten again and unable to realize his potential and live in complete freedom.\nThe claimant submitted identity documents, namely his passport and documents related to his studies. The panel has no doubt as to the claimant's identity. Moreover, the claimant's testimony was credible and spontaneous and free of contradictions. The panel has no doubt as to the claimant's sexual orientation.\nThe claimant submitted medical certificates obtained in Canada that support and corroborate the facts described in his Personal Information Form (PIF), namely that the discrimination he was subjected to in Lebanon and by his family led to a major depression, which caused him to attempt to commit suicide. He is still receiving treatment and is also currently taking medication.\nThe claimant described his life and the many difficulties he has had to face, such as the fact that he had to hide his homosexuality; that his family was ashamed of him; and that he could not rely on them for support or help.\nThe documentary evidence adduced corroborates in all respects the description given by the claimant and demonstrates the extent to which Lebanese society rejects and harasses people whose sexual orientation differs from what is considered to be normal, and it refers to numerous cases in which people have been attacked, insulted and humiliated on the street.\nThe panel finds that the claimant has no internal flight alternative in Lebanon either, due to the prejudice in Lebanese society in general with respect to homosexuals. Based on the documentary evidence adduced, the panel also finds that the claimant cannot benefit from State protection as there are in fact provisions dealing with homosexuality even in the penal code that make it an offence merely to engage in homosexual activities and for which individuals may be imprisoned.\nFor all these reasons, the panel finds that the fear of persecution of the claimant, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, is based on one of the five Convention grounds and that, under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, he is a \"Convention refugee.\"2\nDiane Fecteau\nDiane Fecteau\nMarch 7, 2003\nDate\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - ORAL DECISION - SOCIAL GROUP - HOMOSEXUALS - DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE - INTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE - STATE PROTECTION - MALE - POSITIVE - LEBANON\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, reads, in part, as follows:\n\" 97.

(The claimant testified that he had been recognized as a refugee by the UNHCR in this country).\nALLEGATIONS\nThe following is a summary of the allegations from the claimant's written declaration and his oral testimony.\nMr. XXXXXXX alleges that he is a member of a family of Kurdish nationality.\nIn 1986, he and his family moved from XXXXX to XXXXXX because of his father's political opinion against Saddam Hussein.\nIn June of the same year, the family moved to Iran where they claimed refugee status.\nThe claim was denied because the claimants did not have official identity documents issued by Iraqi authorities. Consequently, in XXXXX 1988, the family moved to Pakistan.\nMr. XXXXXXX alleges that, two months later, they were recognized as refugees by U.N. organization (UNHCR) in Pakistan. They then moved to Islamabad. After a short while, the claimant's father changed his previous political allegiances and became a member of Al Maktah Harekeh (a Muslim Fundamentalist group).\nThe family subsequently moved to Peshawar and they lost all contact with the U.N. organization.\nThe claimant's father became violent towards the children. The claimant's uncle promised to help the family leave Pakistan and find asylum in another country. He paid 4 000 US dollars to an agent to help the claimant flee to Canada, where he applied for asylum.\nANALYSIS\nThe claimant's designated representative was only present in the hearing room in two occasions (23\/12\/2002 and 28\/02\/2003) because on May 16, 2003 the claimant attained the age of majority.\nThe only identification document he submitted was a photocopy of an identity card that was impossible to read, therefore, the panel is not satisfied with the proof submitted to support the claimant's identity.\nThe implausibilities, inconsistencies and contradictions between the claimant's written declaration and his oral testimony, as well as his conduct in the circumstances have led the panel to believe that the claimant is not a person in need of protection.\n1) Mr. XXXXXX testified that his uncle has been in possession of the original of his I.D. card since the claimant left XXXXX. However, in Schedule 1 at Question 2 d), the claimant stated: \"Now my mother can send me my I.D. card\".\nWhen asked to explain the inconsistency, Mr. XXXXX said that he meant that his mother could intervene to obtain and send him the I.D. card. The panel believes that the claimant invented the explanation on the spot.\n2) The claimant introduced an illegible fax copy of an I.D. card to prove his identity.\nOn December 23, 2002 (first day of the hearing), the panel gave the claimant until February 28, 2003 to produce the original of his I.D. card as well as a document proving that he and his family had been recognized by the U.N. as refugees in Pakistan.\nOn the date in question, the claimant was not able to provide the panel with the above-mentioned documents.\nSubsequently, the panel gave the claimant until April 4, 2003 to produce the proof of his identity and the U.N. recognition as a refugee in Pakistan.\nAgain, the claimant was not able to produce the documents requested. Again, the panel granted an additional delay until July 7, 2003. Again, the claimant was not able to produce any evidence saying that the documents had been sent from Iraq but to a wrong address and, through his counsel, asked for a new delay.\nThe panel refused and believes that under the circumstances, the claimant did not act in a reasonable manner, seeing as he did not appear to make any effort to obtain and to produce the evidence requested of him. Therefore, the panel has no other choice than take into account the fact that the claimant has no acceptable documentation establishing identity, provided no reasonable explanation for the lack of it and didn't take reasonable means to obtain it.\n3) On question 20 of his PIF, the claimant stated that he lived in Islamabad from 1988 to 1996. However, Schedule 1 (Question 7) indicates instead that the claimant lived in Rawalpindi from 1992 to 2002. When asked to explain the discrepancy, Mr. XXXXX was not able to do so. Although not central to the claim, the discrepancy diminishes the claimant's credibility.\n4) Mr. XXXXX testified that in Pakistan, he worked in a body shop from 2000 to July 2002. However, a background information document indicates that he was a student during that time period.\nWhen asked to explain the inconsistency, Mr. XXX was not able to do so.\nThe panel again believes that the inconsistency diminishes the claimant's credibility.\nCONCLUSION\nIn light of the foregoing, the panel concludes that the claimant failed to establish his identity. Therefore he failed to establish that he is a \"Convention refugee\"1 or a \"person in need of protection\"2. The claim is rejected.\nGiuseppe Manno\nGiuseppe Manno\nJuly 28, 2003\nDate\n\/mc\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. (2001) c. 27 :\n\" 96.

He also claims to be \"a person in need of protection\"2.\nBefore the hearing, the Minister's counsel submitted a notice of intervention in which the claimant was informed that matters involving section 1F (a) and 1F (c) of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention3 may be raised.\nSUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant is an articulate 24-year-old XXXXX of Muslim religion who completed 15 years of schooling and is fluent in English. Resident of New Delhi, he alleges that he was and still is a member of the Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI). He alleges that he was persecuted by the police. He was arrested in XXXX 1996, XXXX 1997, XXXX 1998, XXXX 1999, XXXX 2001 and XXXXX 2002. Each time, he was tortured and beaten by the police.\nThe claimant alleges that the reason for such harm was his involvement in the SIMI, an organization banned by the Indian government on October 25, 2001, under the Prevention of Terrorism Ordinance 2001 (POTO)4.\nDETERMINATION\nThe panel excludes the claimant under section 1F (a) and 1F (c) of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention5.\nANALYSIS\n1) Identity\nThe Immigration and Refugee Protection Act places emphasis on the need to have acceptable documentation establishing identity6. In this case, the claimant provided the original of his identity card with a picture issued by the Election Commission of India (exhibit A-7). Hence, the panel contends that the identity of the claimant has been established.\n2) Membership in SIMI\nAfter assessing the claimant's testimony and PIF as a whole, the panel concludes that the claimant is still a senior member of SIMI:\n1) The claimant indicated that he joined SIMI in XXXX 1995. He was then a student at XXXXXXXXX College. Soon after, in XXXX 1996, he was elected as XXXXXX of the Central Division in New Delhi, a division composed of 400 members. The Central Division is one of five SIMI's divisions in New Delhi. He also stated that SIMI's headquarters were south of New Delhi and that SIMI had approximately 20,000 members all over India;\n2) more importantly, the claimant explained that he and the President of the Central Division were senior members of SIMI, which had 400 senior members across India. Further questioned on his importance in SIMI, the claimant mentioned that he was among the top 100 of the organization's 400 senior members;\n3) among other things, his role consisted of promoting SIMI, recruiting new members, raising money, helping students and participating in monthly meetings held among senior members. He met the President of SIMI three or four times at these meetings;\n4) after his graduation from XXXXXXX College, that is approximately in XXXX 1998, the claimant gave up his position as XXXXX. He \"still maintained ?...? links with SIMI\" until his appointment in XXXX 1999 as a SIMI XXXX of XXXXXXX College. Still a senior member in his new capacity, he then had the \"opportunity of attending meetings of SIMI in which advisors and office bearers of SIMI participated\";\n5) the claimant testified that today he still considers himself a senior member of SIMI.\nTherefore, the claimant demonstrated that not only was he an active member of SIMI, but that he was among the senior members of SIMI, a group comprising 2% of SIMI's 20,000 members across India. Moreover, two years after the Indian government officially declared SIMI a terrorist organization, he still considers himself a senior member of this organization.\n3) SIMI\nThe panel carefully analysed the documentary evidence on SIMI and took into consideration the historical and political perspective on relations between the Hindus and the Muslims. According to the documentary evidence submitted in this case, SIMI is a terrorist organization and moreover, has been a terrorist organization years before it was banned by the Indian government on October 25, 2001, under the Prevention of Terrorism Ordinance 2001 (POTO) as governments through out the world took a closer look at Muslim organizations following the tragic events of September 11, 2001, in the United States of America (USA).\nIn September 2003, Dr Mohammad Ahmadullah Siddiqi acknowledged in an interview that the SIMI he founded in 1977 was \"purely an educational type of organization\"7 and hence, completely different from today's banned outfit. He then explained that:\n\"its main purpose was to study Islam like in a study circle and to present Islam through lectures and seminars to students at colleges and schools.\"8\nHe believed that the organization had started to drift from its original objectives in the late 1980s when he received an invitation to go to Bombay: the SIMI's letterhead had a sign of a fist. He wrote back to explain that he would not attend SIMI's annual convention as:\n\"?...? the most noticeable things about the Prophet Mohammed as described by the Koran is that he spoke of mercy for humankind. How can the followers of that faith can show a fist and think of violence ?...??\"9\nIn fact, in the 1990s, SIMI continued to change to eventually become a terrorist group whose new purpose was:\n\"?...? Jehad against India, the aim of which is to establish Dar-ul-Islam (land of Islam) by either forcefully converting everyone to Islam or by violence.\"10\nThe panel notes that the claimant and his consultant provided no detailed and substantial evidence for the panel to conclude otherwise.\nDocumentary evidence indicates that SIMI is:\n\"?...? reportedly securing generous financial assistance from the World Assembly of Muslim Youth, Riyadh and also maintains close links with the International Islamic Federation of Students' Organizations, Kuwait. ?...? It also has links with the Jamaat-e-Islam (JeI) units in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal. The SIMI is also alleged to have close links with the Pakistani-supported terrorist outfit Hizb-ul-Mujahideen.\"11\nFurthermore, documentary evidence points out that SIMI has contacts with another banned organization under POTO, Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT):\n\"reportedly one of the largest terrorist outfits operating in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) ?...? suspected of involvement in the December 13, 2001 attacks on India's Parliament in New Delhi.\"12\nFor example:\n\"An arrested activist of the proscribed Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI), is reported to have confessed during interrogation on August 21, 2001, that two LeT terrorists had held discussions with SIMI's Malegaon unit in Mumbai on August 6, 2001, to carry out subversive activities in the State of Maharashtra.\"13\nMore importantly, the South Asia Terrorism Portal dresses a list of incidents, from inciting to communal violence and riots to committing terrorist acts, involving SIMI members from 2000 until 2003, the latest terrorist acts being the December 2002, the January 2003 twin blasts, the Ghatkopar bomb blast and the March 2003 Mulund train bomb explosion in Mumbay (Bombay).14 With regard to the most recent attacks in Bombay in August 2003, it is mentioned in an article entitled \"Bloody Monday\" of the Time Asia Magazine that although there was no public statement of responsibility, \"a leader of the outlawed student Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) met TIME in Bombay two months ago and spoke plainly of his group's intentions to target the city.\"15 Among reported criminals acts concerning SIMI before October 2001, an active member of SIMI was the prime suspect accused of planting a high-power bomb in the Sabarmati Express on August 14, 2000: 10 persons were killed and 65 injured.16 The panel noted that the claimant never dissociated himself from the organization, even though he knew that terrorist acts were committed by some of its members in order to carry out the purposes of SIMI.\nConfronted with the documentary evidence about SIMI's involvement in terrorism, the claimant answered that he only supported the good deeds. The panel is of the opinion that supporting \"good deeds\" within a terrorist organization is providing support to the terrorists. He maintained that SIMI was a peaceful organization whose goal was to obey the five pillars of Islam. However, further confronted with SIMI's violent actions through the years, he first mentioned that he did not know about the bad elements in SIMI and there has never been a mention of violent actions, but eventually admitted that there were bad elements. He then adjusted his testimony by mentioning that he had learned about these terrorist acts by reading the newspapers. Questioned as to what he did since he was a senior member, he stated that he brought up the issue at the monthly senior members' meetings in XXXX 1999. Further questioned as to why he did not leave SIMI, he kept repeating that he wanted to continue his good work and that he had never been involved in anything wrong. He also blamed the media, stating it was controlled by the Hindu government, and qualified SIMI's ban as part of the government of India's policy to suppress minorities.\nIn conclusion, the panel rejects the claimant's above explanations. The evidence demonstrates that the claimant was a willing and knowing accomplice in the goals of SIMI, including its violent activities to fulfill Jehad. As the Federal Court of Appeal stated:\n\"?...? The closer one is to being a leader rather than an ordinary member, the more likely it is that an inference will be drawn that one knew of the crime and shared the organization's purpose in committing that crime. Thus, remaining in an organization in a leadership position with knowledge that the organization was responsible for crimes against humanity may constitute complicity.\"17\nThe claimant is an articulate and well-educated person. Not only did he know about SIMI's violent acts committed against innocent people in the late 1990s and early 2000s, since he was a senior member, but also he chose to stay in this organization. Even today, he still considers himself as a senior member of SIMI. More specifically, concerning the terrorist act of August 2000, given the previous analysis on SIMI, given that the claimant was a senior member and still present in India as he left for Canada in XXXX 2002, the panel finds that the claimant was an accomplice of the act, although SIMI issued no public statement of responsibility. The panel considers this terrorist act as a \"crime against humanity\", as defined in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court: it constitutes a widespread or systematic attack directed against the Indian civilian population, with knowledge of the attack. Moreover, given that this terrorist act violates the human rights contained in the preamble of the United Nation's Charter of Rights, the panel is of the view that this act is also \"contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\"\nHence, taking into consideration the standard of proof required18, the panel comes to the conclusion that it has serious reasons for considering that the claimant, a senior member of SIMI, has been an accomplice in committing \"crimes against humanity\" and \"acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations\", thus should be excluded from refugee protection.\nIn conclusion, under section 98 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act19, a person referred to in section 1F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention, as it is the case of the claimant, is not a \"Convention refugee\", nor \"a person in need of protection\".\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the panel excludes the claimant, XXXXXXXX, under section 1F (a) and 1F (c) of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention. The claimant is not a person who can be protected under sections 96 or 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nPhilippe Patry\nMe Philippe Patry\nNovember 28, 2003\nDate\n\/na\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C.

He alleged a well-founded fear of persecution in his country of citizenship by reason of his religion and membership in a social group, children who are victims of family violence. He alleged to be a \"person in need of protection\" because his life is in danger and he would be subject to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if he returned to the Republic of Mali.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant is 19. He was born to and grew up in a Muslim family. The claimant's father XXXXXX at the XXXXXX, a Muslim centre, in XXXXXX, a district of Bamako, where he gives Koranic courses. The claimant's father is also a XXXXXXX man.\nThe claimant alleged that both his mother and father were Muslim fundamentalists. The claimant's mother died in 1993.\nThe claimant went to a Koranic school from age four to eight and subsequently attended a regular school while his father taught him the Koran on weekends. The claimant also went to the Koranic school on holidays.\nAt 16, the claimant, who often visited a Christian family in his neighbourhood, started to read documents and books on Jesus Christ, and watch movies that his friends showed him. The claimant subsequently started going to the Catholic church in Badalabougou while continuing to practice Islam at home.\nOn XXXXXX, 2002, the claimant was baptized as \"XXXXX\" at the Catholic church and that day decided to stop practising Islam. The claimant did not go to the mosque after his baptism ceremony. When his father asked him why he did not attend, the claimant told him that he had joined the Christian faith. The claimant was subsequently assaulted by his father, who threatened to kill him with a knife. He managed to escape from his home and take refuge with his Christian friend Paulin.\nOn XXXXXXX, 2002, the claimant went to XXXXX to see his maternal uncle, who agreed to let the claimant stay with him. After listening to his story, the uncle advised him to leave Mali.\nThe claimant left Bamako with a fraudulent French passport on XXXXX, 2002. After a stopover in Paris, he arrived in Montreal the next day and claimed refugee protection on September 13, 2002.\nDECISION\nThe panel finds that the claimant is not a \"Convention refugee\"1 or a \"person in need of protection,\"2 for the following reasons.\nANALYSIS\nThe claimant was not credible, and neither was his testimony regarding some essential aspects of his refugee protection claim.\nIdentity and credibility\nIn order to establish his identity, the claimant submitted a copy of an extract from his birth certificate (Exhibit P-3), as well as his Malian national identity card (Exhibit P-2), both of which are in the possession of Immigration Canada (Exhibit A-31).\nThe claimant testified that he grew up in XXXXXXX, a district of Bamako. The panel noted that the copy of the extract from his birth certificate was issued in the district of XXXXXXX. Faced with the panel's specialized knowledge that the commune number did not appear in the space provided for this purpose-and that \"Bamako\" was indicated in the space reserved for the place of issue-whereas the commune number appeared on the stamp at the bottom of the document, the claimant had no explanation for the panel. Moreover, at the bottom of the page was a caption that read, [translation] \"Certified in accordance with the original, No. XXXX, 1984, at the Bamako vital statistics centre,\" whereas the XXXXXXX headquarters appeared in the letterhead. This is inconsistent. The panel does not attach any probative value to the copy of the extract from the claimant's birth certificate.\nAs for the claimant's Malian national identity card (Exhibits P-2 and A-31), it was issued on XXXXXXXX, 2002 with the help of his uncle, who asked a police officer, a friend of his, to issue it. The claimant did not go to the police station; he picked up his card at the police officer's home before boarding an airplane in Bamako. When asked why his national identity card indicated that he was a student, whereas in his testimony the claimant said that he left school in XXXXX 2001, the claimant explained that, because he had not finished school, he was still considered a student. The claimant said that he had had his fingerprint taken when he received the card. When asked why he had not signed his identity card as required in the space provided for this purpose, the claimant said that, if one reports in person, one may be asked to sign, and if not, one signs afterwards.\nGiven the little formality involved in the issuance of this identity document, and given the particular circumstances of this case, the panel gives no credence to this process.\nThe claimant also submitted a certificate of education issued by the XXXXXXXXXX secondary school in XXXXXXXXX on XXXXXX, 2003, when the claimant was in Canada (Exhibit P-4). This document indicated that the claimant attended the school during tenth grade from XXXXX 2000 to XXXXX 2001. The claimant said that he obtained this document through his uncle and that it was delivered to him in Canada by a fellow Malian. The claimant's Personal Information Form (PIF, Exhibit P-1), which he completed and signed on November 12, 2002, indicated that the claimant attended XXXXXX elementary school from XXXXX 1991 to XXXXX 1997, and XXXXXXXXXXX secondary school from XXXXX 1997 to XXXXX 2001. On August 25, 2003, the claimant filed as Exhibit P-7 corrections to his PIF, indicating in his answer to question 17-in accordance with Exhibit P-4- that he had attended XXXXXXX school rather than XXXXXXX elementary school from XXXX 1991 to XXXX 2000, and XXXXXXXX secondary school from XXXXX 2000 to XXXXX 2001.\nWhen confronted with his answer to question 7 of the Background Information form (IMM 5474, Exhibit A-31), which he completed when he claimed refugee protection and in which he indicated that he was a \"student\" at XXXXXXXX school from 1991 to 2001, the claimant acknowledged his signature at the bottom of the form and said that it had been completed by his counsel and that there had been no interpreter. He was then asked why he had signed the form; the claimant had no explanation for the panel. The panel rejects the claimant's testimony and determines that it is not credible. He completed the refugee protection claim3 with the help of his own counsel. His explanation that there was no interpreter is unreasonable. The panel found that the claimant spoke good French and that his comprehension of the language was such that, although he chose to proceed in Bambara, he spontaneously answered in French the questions he was asked. The claimant also chose to hear the lawyers' observations and submissions in French, relieving the interpreter of his duties of his own accord. Moreover, the claimant never indicated in the Background Information form that he had attended a school in XXXXXXXXX, that is, a district different from his own (XXXXXXXXX). Le panel attaches no probative value to the certificate of education filed in Exhibit P-4.\nThe panel finds that the claimant was unable to provide any material evidence of his itinerary or the dates of his trip, demonstrating that his allegation that he used a fraudulent French passport was accurate. Although he said that the facilitator had instructed him to remember that name and age of the person whose identity he used to travel, the claimant testified that he did not remember these facts. The only information he was able to give the panel was the person's first name, XXXXX. The claimant also did not produce the airline tickets or boarding passes he used to travel to Canada, explaining that the facilitator took all these travel documents back. The panel therefore does not have any important or relevant travel documents that could at least have helped corroborate the claimant's testimony as to his trip from Mali to Canada. The panel is of the opinion that the decision in Elazi4 applies in this case:\nI take this opportunity to add that it is entirely reasonable for the Refugee Division to attach great importance to a claimant's passport and his air ticket. In my opinion, these documents are essential to establish the claimant's identity and his journey to come to Canada. Unless it can be assumed that a refugee status claimant is actually a refugee, it seems unreasonable to me to ignore the loss of these documents without a valid explanation. In my view, it is to easy for a claimant to simply state that he has lost these documents or the facilitator has taken them. If the Refugee Division insists on these documents being produced, the facilitators may have to change their methods.\nMinimizing the importance of the passport and air ticket as documents to be produced or ignoring their non-submission for all sorts of reasons in my opinion only serves to encourage all those whose only purpose is to take advantage of a system which is intended solely to enable genuine refugees to come to Canada.\nThe panel finds that the claimant did not provide acceptable documentation establishing identity within the meaning of section 106 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Consequently, the panel does not know who the claimant is, where he lived, or what his status was. The panel does not know whether he is a citizen or resident of Mali, or a citizen or permanent resident of another country. The panel also does not know how old the claimant is or where he comes from. The only evidence the panel has is the claimant's testimony, which the panel finds generally not to be credible. Given that the panel does not know who the claimant is, where he lived, or what his status was, it attaches no credibility to his account of persecution and threat to his life, which is not reliable.\nThe claimant testified that he feared returning to Mali because he was afraid of being killed by father for converting to Catholicism.\nThe claimant said that he started reading Christian doctrine because he was attracted by the good behaviour of Christians friends living in his neighbourhood; they were calmer when they quarrelled and never had meals without giving thanks to Jesus. The claimant said that he started to go to church at 17 and converted at 18. When asked at what point his father was informed of his conversion, the claimant answered, \"When it was over, on XXXXX, 2002.\" He was then asked what \"it\" meant and, smiling, the claimant corrected his testimony, saying it was his baptism. Given that the claimant alleged he had been interested in the Christian religion since the age of 16, that he was baptized, and that he had attended mass every Sunday since arriving in Canada, the panel wanted to assess his basic knowledge of Catholicism.\nThe refugee protection officer (RPO) asked him what the main sacraments of the Catholic religion were. The claimant answered, \"Jesus is the messenger.\" When told that this was the wrong answer, the claimant said in French that he did not know the word for \"sacrament\" in Bambara. The question had in fact been translated into Bambara for him, but the word sacrament had remained in French. He was subsequently asked the same question with simpler words, that is, what the other Christian ceremonies or events that demonstrated his devotion to God were, the baptism he alleged receiving being the first. The claimant was absolutely incapable of answering this question.\nWhen the panel asked him whether the ceremony of reconciliation or first communion meant something to him, the claimant answered in French: \"If it was in Bambara, I would know it, but not in French.\" The interpreter, who was helping the claimant and who had extensive experience and indisputable expertise, explained that the words \"communion\" and \"sacrament\" did not exist in Bambara, as they are universal names that are specific to the Catholic religion. The panel does not believe the claimant's excuse of not understanding these simple words, which are basic to of the Catholic religion, in order to justify his ignorance of this religion.\nTo give the claimant another chance, the panel asked him how may apostles Jesus had. The claimant again answered in French, asking what apostle meant in Bambara. The RPO replied that they were referring to the disciples of Jesus and, to make sure the claimant understood the question, he specified that it was like the disciples of the prophet in the Koran. The claimant then answered \"Judas and Peter,\" but the panel told him that he did not have to name them, that the number was sufficient. The claimant gave a general response, saying there were several. When asked to be more specific, the claimant said that he did not know, yet in the same breath claimed that the question was not specific and was poorly translated. This answer permanently damaged the claimant's credibility, which was already seriously undermined.\nThe fact that the claimant named two of Jesus' apostles shows that he understood the question, which was translated using the words that existed in Bambara. The panel is of the opinion that it was dishonest of the claimant to blame the interpreter for his own inability to the panel's simple questions. The claimant's testimony has absolutely no credibility.\nEven if the panel agrees that certain words may not exist in Bambara because they are specific to the Catholic religion, the claimant testified that he went to the Salvation Army Church in downtown Montreal, where he attended mass in French every Sunday from 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. Yet he never heard the word \"communion.\" To that effect, counsel for the claimant argued that perhaps her client did not stay until the end of the ceremony. Nonetheless, the claimant was asked whether there was a moment during mass when people got up to join the priest in front. The claimant said yes, adding that some people knelt down to pray to God and others wrote their problems down and put them in the \"burden box.\" Given this strange answer from someone who alleged he was a Catholic, the panel asked him whether he had ever seen anyone at church eating something given to him by the priest. The claimant answered \"No.\" The claimant is not credible. It is common knowledge for all Catholics that communion is an integral part of mass. The claimant did not establish that he attended mass.\nFinally, the claimant filed as Exhibit P-5 a baptism card issued XXXXX, 2002 for a baptism celebrated the previous day, as well as a letter dated XXXX, 2003 from XXXXXXXXXX, the person in charge of youth in the XXXXXX parish in XXXXXX (Exhibit P-6). Both documents were sent to him in Canada by his uncle in Mali. When asked to describe the baptism, the claimant said that [translation] \"they put some water on my head and something resembling candy in my mouth,\" without being able to identify the candy. Exhibit P-5 did not indicate the names of his godfather or godmother in the space provided for this purpose. The claimant said that, given that the space was not completed, he had none. He said that he did not know what the words godfather and godmother meant and could not explain their role in the baptism. The panel finds it implausible that the claimant had no concept of the generally known fact that a godfather or godmother, or both, are the ones who present the soon-to-be baptized person so that he or she may enter the Catholic faith. Considering the above facts, the homemade appearance of Exhibit P-5, and the claimant's total lack of credibility, the panel attaches no probative value to Exhibit P-5.\nAfter analysing all the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant did not discharge his burden of demonstrating that he converted to the Christian religion of Catholicism. As a result, the panel attaches no weight to Exhibit P-6,5 which it considers a self-serving document.6 Consequently, the panel does not need to analyse the case any further.\nCONCLUSION\nThe panel determines that XXXXXXXXXXXX is not a \"Convention refugee\"7 or a \"person in need of protection,\"8 and rejects his refugee protection claim. The panel determines that there is no credible basis for this claim, within the meaning of section 107(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nRuth Delisle\nMe Ruth Delisle\nOctober 8, 2003\nDate\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - RELIGION - PARTICULAR SOCIAL GROUP - DOMESTIC VIOLENCE - IDENTITY - CREDIBILITY - INCONSISTENCIES - NO CREDIBLE BASIS - MALE - NEGATIVE - MALI\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C.

She alleged a well-founded fear of persecution in her country of origin by reason of her sex and her membership in the particular social group of women victims of spousal abuse in Venezuela. She also alleged that she could be subject to a risk to her life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment should she return to Venezuela.\nALLEGED FACTS\nThe evidence in the case was adduced by the claimant and her counsel. It consisted of the following elements: the claimant's Personal Information Form (PIF), her oral testimony, her identity documents, a brief psychological evaluation and documents concerning the social and political situation and exercise of human rights in Venezuela. The panel also considered Canada's Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution (1996 update). The claimant's PIF and oral testimony disclosed the following facts:\nThe claimant was born and stated that she had always lived in San Cristobal, in the State of Tachira, where according to her PIF she completed fourteen years of education. In her answer to question 18 on her PIF, she disclosed that she had worked as a XXXXX merchant from 1992 until her final departure from the country. From her first conjugal relationship, she had a son who is now 21 years old and still lives in Venezuela. Since XXXXX 1998, she had lived with her common-law spouse, a man by the name of XXXXXX XXXXXX, who is three years older than her and was \"probably\" in Venezuela, according to her. They had no children.\nThe claimant based her claim for refugee protection essentially on the violence that she said her common-law spouse, a jealous man given to excessive drinking, had inflicted on her since XXXXX 1999. She indicated in her PIF and in her testimony that her former common-law spouse had, on a number of occasions, beaten her violently, raped her and threatened to kill her in the three years since then. She explained that, despite all this, she had stayed with him throughout this period because she was afraid that he would carry out his threats. In addition, her former common-law spouse would sometimes apologize and beg her forgiveness with the result that during certain periods they lived [Translation] \"the normal life of a normal couple\" and both made business trips outside the country, including at least five trips in 2001 and one in 2002.\nThe claimant testified that because of her mother's experience with violence, she had never sought help from the authorities in her country because, according to her, the authorities [Translation] \"do nothing for abused women.\" She did not have a medical certificate either, despite the injuries allegedly inflicted on her by her former common-law spouse, who had no compunction about using a knife or a pistol or even slamming her against the stairs while pulling her hair so that her [Translation] \"knees were injured for life,\" as she stated in paragraph 18 of her PIF narrative. She explained that her former common-law spouse was never very far from her since the XXXXX he owned was close to the matrimonial home and it was impossible for her to get away to receive medical treatment. The only time the claimant managed to escape, in XXXXX 2002, to an aunt's home in Valencia, in the state of Carabobo, she was found less than a week later by her former common-law spouse who brought her back to the San Cristobal house by force.\nThe claimant stated that, given that situation, she had requested financial assistance from her parents so that she could flee Venezuela on XXXXX, 2002, transiting through Costa Rica and Guatemala, and finally landing in Mexico the next day. There, at a cost of US$2,000, she purchased a false Mexican passport in the name of XXXXXXXXXXXX in order to enter Canada without obtaining a Canadian visa, which was difficult to get in Venezuela. She stayed there for XXX days without seeking the protection of the Mexican authorities. The claimant finally entered Canada on August 27, 2002, where, one month later, she indicated her intention to claim refugee protection.\nThe claimant alleged that her life would be in danger if she were to return to anywhere in Venezuela, where her former common-law spouse could sooner or later find her [Translation] \"very easily\". She added that it was pointless for her to count on the protection of the authorities in her country, where problems involving domestic violence would be seen as private matters that the spouses ought to settle between themselves.\nThese, in substance, were the facts brought to the panel's attention by the claimant, who was the only person to testify in this case. The panel must determine whether she is a \"Convention refugee\"1 and\/or a \"person in need of protection\"2 in accordance with the criteria set out in sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nANALYSIS\nA thorough analysis of all the evidence before the panel, both the testimony and the documentary evidence, leads the panel to conclude that the claimant has discharged the burden on her of proving that she has a well-founded fear of persecution in Venezuela. The panel reached this conclusion for the following reasons:\nThe claimant's testimony was direct and spontaneous. Some aspects of her claim raise doubts, however. The panel could not conceal its surprise that the claimant had failed to produce a certificate of medical treatment if she had been beaten by her former common-law spouse with such violence and over such an extended period that her knees were injured for life, as she stated in her PIF narrative. The claimant explained that she had never had an opportunity to consult a health professional because her former common-law spouse was always present and he would prevent her from doing so. However, she stated in her PIF that he had been away at least once, in mid-XXXX 2002, when he left Venezuela for Colombia, where he procured for himself a revolver, among other things.\nOn the only occasion when the claimant was able to get to a hospital, she did not receive any treatment because there was a doctors' strike that day and no medical services were available for cases like hers. During the times when things between them were good and the couple traveled, as the claimant painstakingly explained, she ceased to feel uncomfortable. These explanations do not satisfy the panel and, in our opinion, the claimant at the very least greatly exaggerated the injuries she claimed to have received at the hands of her former common-law spouse.\nIt is also surprising that the claimant was able to stay with her former common-law spouse until she finally left the country and to make so many trips with him - five in 2001 alone - if he was as violent as she claimed. Her explanations on this subject are not completely unreasonable or inconsistent with the psychology and behaviour of women victims of violence as described in our Board's Guidelines in this regard. In such a context and considering the rather cursory psychological evaluation produced in evidence, the panel finally decided, though not without great reluctance, to give the claimant the benefit of the doubt concerning the violence that she claimed to have suffered at the hands of this man XXXXXX XXXXXXX.\nIt therefore remains for the panel to ascertain whether women victims of violence can, at the present time, obtain the protection of the Venezuelan authorities. On this subject, the panel finds it useful to quote certain significant passages from the most recent independent documents submitted in evidence:\nViolence against women continued to be a problem, and women faced substantial institutional social prejudice with respect to rape and domestic violence during the year. Domestic violence against women was very common and was aggravated by the country's economic difficulties. There were 8,411 cases of domestic violence reported to the authorities during the year. Many domestic violence cases were not reported to the police. The police generally were unwilling to intervene to prevent domestic violence and the courts rarely prosecuted those accused of such abuse, according to local monitors. In addition, poor women generally were unaware of legal remedies and have little access to them. The law requires police to report domestic violence and obligates hospital personnel to adviser the authorities when it admits patients who are victims of domestic abuse cases.3\nFrom the point of view of the advocates, the interpretation aimed at protecting the safety of the person who is at risk must prevail. However, there are still justice administration operators that oppose formalities.\nThe scarce preparation of the officers of the organisms that receive the complaints brings consequences over the duration of the processes and on the application of the laws. The organism do not receive the complaints and send it to other instances.\nThe Division of the Judicial Technical Police (PTJ) against violence aimed at women and the family is overloaded. The other organisms, instead of adapting their services to the care of maltreated women, are sending the complaints mentioned Specialized Division of the PTJ and this entity, at the same time, returns the envoy to the original receiving unit, with the consequent prejudice to the affected person. (...)\nThe person assaulted may present a medical certificate from a physician working in a public or private institution, but the receiving instances must inform about the requirement of the examination of the forensic doctor in order to process the complaint. The forensic doctors are few and of difficult access, which in itself is a practical obstacle.\nThe lawyers' services are costly and many times the victims lack the resources. The Law against Violence aimed at Women and the Family limits itself to encouraging the non-government organizations to intervene in the judicial process (...)\nThe officers in charge of the reception of complaints tend not to pay attention to psychological violence and threats. The administration tends to view the severe damages as slight.\nThere is no real infrastructure that permits the effective application of some of the dispositions of the dispositions of the Law against Violence aimed at Women and the Family.4\nIn light of these non-exhaustive citations, the panel finds it reasonable to conclude that the authorities in Venezuela are still unable to offer adequate protection overall to women who are victims of domestic violence. According to the documentary evidence, improvements are underway to try to correct the current situation, but it will doubtless take some time for the independent agencies to be able to ensure the effectiveness of those improvements in practice.\nBefore concluding, it must be made clear that the claimant's identity documents adduced in evidence are acceptable and that the panel has no doubts on this subject.\nCONCLUSION\nThe evidence concerning the most important points of this claim for refugee protection has been held sufficient to establish that, if the claimant returned to Venezuela, she would have a reasonable chance of persecution at this time. For this reason, this panel finds that the claimant, XXXXX XXXXXX XXXXX, is a \"Convention refugee\" and her claim for refugee protection is therefore allowed.\nCharles DeBlois\nCharles DeBlois\nOctober 29, 2003\nDate\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - SOCIAL GROUP - WOMEN - DOMESTIC VIOLENCE - STATE PROTECTION - DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE - WOMAN - FAVOURABLE - VENEZUELA\n1 96.

He is claiming refugee protection in Canada for reasons of his membership in a social group and his imputed political opinion. He also claims to be a person in need of protection in that he would be personally subject to torture and a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if he were to return to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant said in answer to question 41 on his Personal Information Form (PIF) that his father had operated a XXXXXXXX service, which allegedly was destroyed on XXXXXX, 1998, and his father had build a XXXX shop in its place.\nHe said that after the failure of the Sun City talks in South Africa for the inter-Congolese dialogue, his father allegedly XXXXX thousands of pamphlets denouncing the failure on XXX XX, 2002, and on XXX XX, 2002, soldiers allegedly went to the XXXX shop, ransacked it, arrested the claimant and put him in jail until XXXX, 2002, when he was released thanks to the help of his uncles.\nHe allegedly left the country on XXXXX, 2002, to come to Canada and claimed refugee protection on September 16, 2002.\nANALYSIS\nAs an identity document the claimant filed an attestation of loss of identity documents (Exhibit P-4). The exhibit was not dated and did not look anything like the documents the panel usually sees, according to its specialized knowledge. The phrase \"attestation of loss of identity documents\" was not centred with the rest of the text, and therefore the panel gave no probative value to this document.\nAnother exhibit filed to establish the claimant's identity was Exhibit P-5, a certificate of the claimant's mother's death, which apparently occurred on XXXXX, 2002. When confronted about why the usual stamp was missing-the stamp mentioned in tabs 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 of the Binder and usually appearing on this type of document-the claimant said that the receipt but not the death certificate had been stamped. When confronted about whether he had often seen the receipt stamped instead of the main document, the claimant answered No. The panel gave no probative value to the document.\nWhen confronted about how one could get a death certificate simply by presenting an identity card, the claimant said that his uncle had obtained the document. The panel gave no probative value to the death certificate, because a death certificate is not made from an identity card put rather from a doctor's report.\nAs regards Exhibit P-2, a birth certificate, the panel gave it no probative value, because it did not bear the country's usual stamp. When confronted, the claimant said he could not answer, because his uncle had obtained the document.\nAs regards Exhibit P-3, a state diploma, the panel gave it no probative value. For one thing it was impossible to recognize the claimant in the picture, and for another the claimant said he had signed the blank state diploma in 1995 but changed his story after the break, saying he had signed it when he got it in 1999. This unexplained contradiction undermined the claimant's credibility.\nThe claimant did not present the false passport with which he said he had travelled. The claimant said he had given it back to the smuggler, as the smuggler had demanded. He did not have his plane ticket, boarding pass or baggage tag.\nConsidering that the claimant has been in Canada since September 8, 2002-more than a year-he has had ample time to provide the panel with acceptable documents to establish his identity. The panel finds that the claimant has not produced acceptable identity documents within the meaning of section 106 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nMoreover, the panel finds that Elazi1 applies in this case and cites:\nI take this opportunity to add that it is entirely reasonable for the Refugee Division to attach great importance to a claimant's passport and his air ticket. In my opinion, these documents are essential to establish the claimant's identity and his journey to come to Canada. Unless it can be assumed that a refugee status claimant is actually a refugee, it seems unreasonable to me to ignore the loss of these documents without a valid explanation. In my view, it is to [sic] easy for a claimant to simply state that he has lost these documents or the facilitator has taken them. If the Refugee Division insists on these documents being produced, the facilitators may have to change their methods.\nMinimizing the importance of the passport and air ticket as documents to be produced or ignoring their non-submission for all sorts of reasons in my opinion only serves to encourage all those whose only purpose is to take advantage of a system which is intended solely to enable genuine refugees to come to Canada.\nSince the panel does not know where the claimant comes from, where he has lived and with what status, it is not required to pursue its analysis of this claim any further, since he has failed to discharge the burden that rested on him of establishing that he is a citizen of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and did not file documents confirming his identity.\nCONCLUSION\nIn light of the above, the panel determines that XXXXXXXXXXX is not a Convention refugee2 within the meaning of section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, or a person in need of protection3 and rejects his claim for refugee protection.\nJean Marie Chastenay\nJean-Marie Chastenay\nDecember 16, 2003\nDate\n1 Elazi, Iseikete Simon v.

He and his father were XXXXX in XXX village. He alleges that his father was killed by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels in XXXX 1997, during their attack on XXX village. Two weeks later, during another attack by the rebels, the claimant's mother and his two siblings were killed. The claimant stayed in his village and continued to XXXX until XXXX 2001. However, he was afraid for his life and security, because the civilians continued to be killed, both by the rebels and the government troops.\nIn XXXX 2001, the claimant left Sierra Leone by boat. He went to XXXXX, where he got on a ship as a stowaway going to Brazil. While in the process of determination of his refugee status in Brazil, the claimant was exposed to all sorts of danger, since he had no place to live and he had to live on the street. In XXXXX 2002, he got on another ship, sailing this time to Canada, again as a stowaway. He was discovered by the crew and handed over to the Canadian authorities. On November 9, 2002, upon his arrival in Canada, he claimed protection.\nShould he go back to his country, the claimant is afraid of the rebels, who attack people in Sierra Leone and kill or torture them if they refuse to join their forces.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\nThe only identity document submitted by the claimant is a refugee claimant card issued to him by the Brazilian authorities. It was valid for 90 days, and it expired on XXXXX, 2002. The document is based on personal data given by the claimant himself to the Brazilian authorities.\nHowever, the claimant's testimony concerning his origins, his occupation, his village, and the reasons for the absence of other identity documents was detailed, spontaneous, and generally credible. Consequently, even though I do not have any reliable document corroborating the claimant's identity, I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt and to accept his identity.\nFear of return\nThe claimant testified that his family was killed during the civil war in Sierra Leone. His father, his mother, and two siblings became random victims of that civil war. They were killed, according to the claimant, during two separate attacks of the rebels on his village, in XXXXX 1997. He does not know why his father and his father's friend were killed while they were coming back home from XXXXX. They were both shot, and the claimant saw traces of beating on their bodies. He does not know what had happened. He believes that it is possible that his father was killed because the rebels wanted to enrol him in their forces, and he refused. That however is only the claimant's speculation, since nobody saw what had really happened.\nAs for the claimant's mother, brother, and sister, they were killed when the cooking hut of the family was set on fire. Again, the claimant had not seen what had happened, but he testified that many other houses in the village had been burned down during the attack of the rebels, and many other civilians were killed. The claimant continued living in his village for another four years. He always felt insecure, as did the other people in his village and, as a matter of fact, many other people in Sierra Leone. However, he was never personally targeted, either by the rebels or by the government troops.\nIs the claimant a \"Convention refugee\", as per Section 96, or a \"person in need of protection\", as per Section 97(1)a) or b)? In my analysis, I took into consideration the Chairperson's Guidelines concerning civil non-combatants fearing persecution during civil war. From the claimant's testimony, it is clear to me that for the most part, his fear is general. He is afraid to become a random victim of the war, as his family allegedly was, as well as hundreds of civilians in his country. This fear is not based on any Convention ground. As for his fear of reprisal by the rebels if he were to refuse to join their forces, the documentary evidence (see page 4) leads me to conclude that there is no serious possibility that, in the present circumstances in Sierra Leone, the RUF would attempt to forcibly recruit the claimant. Consequently, I conclude that the claimant is not a \"Convention refugee\", as described in Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nSimilarly, concerning a risk to his life and a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, as defined in Section 97(1)b), in order for that section to apply, the risk has to be personal, and not \"faced generally by other individuals in or from that country\" (Section 97(1)b) (ii)). However, based on the claimant's testimony and his counsel's submissions, I conclude that the risk to his life and the risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment feared by the claimant is general to the whole population of Sierra Leone. That risk is linked to the civil war which has been fought in Sierra Leone since 1991, and which, according to the claimant and his counsel, can start again at any moment. However, since the alleged risk is not personal, but faced generally by the whole population, I conclude that the provisions of Section 97(1)b) do not apply to the claimant.\nThe counsel argued that even though the claimant was not personally targeted, he should be accepted, because the situation in Sierra Leone and in the region is volatile and precarious and that the war can start again any time, as it did in Liberia or Ivory Coast. I cannot accept this argument as valid, in the light of law and jurisprudence. My duty is not to assess the risk of return, but to determine if the claimant is a \"Convention refugee\" or a \"person in need of protection\", as defined in Sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The risk assessments would eventually be conducted by the immigration authorities at the time when the claimant would be going back to Sierra Leone. Should the civil war start again in that country, I am sure it will be taken into consideration by the Canadian authorities.\nConcerning the alleged fear of torture (Section 97(1)a)), a risk of torture has to be personal. According to this section, the removal would subject the claimant personally \"to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture\". Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture stipulates that the pain or suffering \"is inflicted by, or at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official and other person acting in an official capacity\". The claimant alleges that he fears torture at the hands of the rebels, who might want to incorporate him forcibly into their forces. However, I believe that the rebels cannot be considered as \"public official\" or \"person acting in an official capacity\", in the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture. In my understanding, it clearly refers to the state and its apparatus, and not to rebel forces attacking the civilian population.\nIn addition to that, no evidence was submitted to the tribunal to the effect that there are substantial grounds to believe that the claimant is in danger of torture from the Sierra Leone government or any other state agent. As for the RUF rebels, according to the documentary evidence,1 demobilization and disarmament was completed by January 2002. In the US Department of State Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2002, we read as follows:\n\"On January 18 (2002), the devastating 11-year civil conflict officially ended when all parties to the conflict issued a Declaration of the End of the War. The Government since asserted control over the whole country, backed by a large U.N. peacekeeping force. Revolutionary United Front (RUF) insurgents, who fought successive governments since 1991, completed disarmament and demobilization. The Civil Defense Force (CDF), a government-allied militia, also disarmed and demobilized (...) In May peaceful presidential and parliamentary elections were held (...) Many international monitors declared the elections free and fair; however, there were numerous reports of election irregularities and abuses. Since the resumption of the disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) process in May 2001, an estimated 72,500 former combatants disarmed; on January 31, the disarmament and demobilization sections of the program were completed. The process of reintegration continued at year's end.\"\nAnd further down, we read:\n\"With the end of war and demobilization of the RUF and CDF, many systematic and serious human rights abuses ended. During the year, there were no reports of unlawful killings or other abuses by the CDF in support of the Government.\"\nDespite the political instability in the region, particularly in Liberia and Ivory Coast, and several serious political, social, and economic problems still persisting in Sierra Leone, I do not believe that in the present circumstances, the claimant has established a serious possibility of a danger of torture or risk to his life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, either from the government or from the rebels.\nDECISION\nConsidering all the above, I conclude that the claimant, Mr. XXXXXXXX, did not establish that he is a \"Convention refugee\"2 or a \"person in need of protection\",3 as per Sections 96 or 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nBarbara Berger\nBarbara Berger\nAugust 7, 2003\nDate\n\/jcbo\n1 Exhibit A-6: US Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2002, March 2003, and others.\n2 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C.

The two were talking in Mr. XXXXX car when three men appeared, striking at the car windows and insulting and threatening them. They were then beaten and kicked. The claimant alleged that he had been helping Mr. XXXXX sell his cars and that he earned a commission on this sale.\nThe claimant went to see the doctor after this incident.\nThe incident gave rise to many problems. Two men, one of whom had been present on XXXXX, threatened the claimant, telling him that he would be advised to keep quiet, adding that they knew the claimant had a family.\nHis friend told him that these people did not want them to file a complaint with the police because the situation would become worse.\nHis friend finally told him that he had bought a used car to resell without realizing that the car had been stolen. He did not realize this until later and wanted to return the car to the person who had sold it. The latter did not want to return the money to him and this led to an argument. The friend stated that he would report the seller to the police. From that moment, the friend started receiving threats. The people involved in this therefore believed that the claimant was his accomplice.\nThe claimant noticed that he was being followed and also received telephone threats telling him to remember the incident of XXXXX, 2002 and to pay attention to his family if he went to the police.\nThe friend eventually closed his business on XXXXX, 2002 and left Mexico City. The claimant did not know where he was.\nAfter his friend left, the claimant was harassed again because the people wanted to know where his friend was.\nAt the hearing, the claimant filed an addition indicating that he had learned in XXXXX 2003 that his friend, XXXXXXX, had filed a complaint concerning the incidents but had not told the claimant. It was one of Mr. XXXXXXXX brothers who told him this and the claimant had no idea when the complaint had been made.\nThe claimant left his country on XXX XXX, 2002 and made a claim for refugee protection in Canada on November 11, 2002, two months after he arrived in Canada.\nANALYSIS\nAfter considering the evidence, both the documentary evidence and the testimony, the panel is of the opinion that the claimant is not a Convention refugee1 or a person in need of protection2 for the reasons below.\nThe claimant stated that he had never sought help or protection from the authorities in his country. However, it is a well-established principle in the case law that a refugee protection claimant must have requested assistance in his own country before seeking international protection, in this instance, in Canada. The claimant never contacted the Mexican authorities before turning to Canada. Except in instances in which the state apparatus has completely broken down, it should be presumed that a state is capable of protecting its citizens. This presumption can be rebutted only by \"clear and convincing\" evidence of the state's inability to provide protection.3\n[N]ations should be presumed capable of protecting their citizens. Security of nationals is, after all, the essence of sovereignty. Absent a situation of complete breakdown of state apparatus [...], it should be assumed that the state is capable of protecting a claimant.\nSuch evidence was not presented by the claimant, who failed to demonstrate that he had acted reasonably in not seeking the state's protection.\nAs another judgment indicates:\nThe burden of proof that rests on the claimant is, in a way, directly proportional to the level of democracy in the state in question...4\nAlthough problems with corruption exist, Mexico cannot be described as a country in which the state apparatus has completely broken down. There are places where complaints can be made, as indicated in document A-1.5 This document lists various federal agencies charged with enforcing the law, such as the Federal Judicial Police, and also mentions the state and federal district police services. If an individual is not satisfied with the response or protection offered by the police, there are remedies and an internal control mechanism within the police, as can be seen at pages 25, 26, 27 and 28 of this document. Document A-1 also indicates at tab 4.6 that corruption is investigated in Mexico and that, although police corruption is a problem there, the authorities have made serious efforts to stop it. Moreover, the Fox government arrested several members of the security forces in 2002, as indicated in another document filed under Exhibit A-1.6\nThe panel therefore cannot conclude, given the aforementioned documentary evidence, that there is \"clear and convincing\" evidence that the state would not make serious efforts to protect the claimant if he were to return to Mexico and report his problems to the authorities.\nThe panel has taken into consideration the three grounds for protection under section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Act and finds that the principal claimant has access to adequate protection by the state and that there is accordingly no serious possibility that, in Mexico, the claimant would be subject personally to any harm in the form of persecution, a risk to his life, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture.\nBefore closing, the panel would like to note that it is satisfied as to the claimant's identity in light of the certified copy of his passport on the record.\nCONCLUSION\nThe claimant is accordingly neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nHis claim for refugee protection in Canada is therefore rejected.\nSylvie L\u00e9vesque\nMe Sylvie L\u00e9vesque\nNovember 27, 2003\nDate\n1 96.

She says she is a citizen of Guinea, which she left on XXXXXXXX, 2002, arriving in Canada on November 5, 2002.\nHer claim for refugee protection has two components. First, she says she has a well-founded fear of persecution based on her membership in a particular social group, that of women.1 Second, she says that she is a \"person in need of protection\"2 in that she is subject to a danger of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention on Torture, to a risk to her life and to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nAt the beginning of the hearing, Robert Naylor was designated to represent her since she was still a minor\nSUMMARY OF THE ALLEGED FACTS\nIn support of her claim, she alleged he following.\nIn her country, she lived with her parents, specifically with her father.\nIn March 2002, her father and her uncles decided to have her excised so that she could be given in marriage afterwards to a man the age of her father who had chosen him because of his financial resources and his promise to give him certain property.\nHer mother, having realized that her husband could not be persuaded to abandon this project, put the problem to one of her highly placed friends. The friend first had the claimant move in with her and then helped her leave the country, which she managed to do on XXXXXXX, 2002.\nANALYSIS\nAfter analysing all of the evidence, both the testimony and the documentary evidence, the panel has determined that the claimant has established a reasonable chance of persecution if she returns to her country.\nIdentity\nThe panel reviewed the exhibits on the record, in particular a photocopy, certified as a true copy,3 of the birth certificate, the original of which was seized by Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC), and Exhibit P-4,4 which is a school certificate of identity. The panel states that it is satisfied as to her identity.\nCredibility\nThe claimant's testimony revealed some weaknesses. It was inconsistent on certain points such as, for example, the number of brothers and sisters she had. She said at first that she had two brothers and one sister and later, three brothers and one sister, but could not really give an explanation for the discrepancy.\nShe first stated that she had stayed with Ms. XXXXXX, beginning in September 2002, and lived there until November of that year. However, in testifying, she said she went to live with Ms. XXXXX, beginning in March 2002.\nShe was unable to explain how her birth certificate and her school certificate of identity, which in theory were with her father, had ended up in Canada. On this subject, a person from the host family she lives with in Montreal testified since she was the one who had had the documents sent from Guinea. She, too, was unable to give any explanation on this subject. The panel decided not to draw negative inferences as to the claimant's credibility from these facts, since she was only 12 years old when all this happened.\nMerits of the claim\nThe issue that arises in this case is whether the claimant, who says she is afraid of being excised, is thereby subject to treatment that can be considered persecution and, if so, whether she can have the protection of the authorities in her country or avail herself of an internal flight alternative.\nWith regard to the first point, the documentation5 is completely clear. It describes the practice of excision in Guinea and indicates that 70% of the women of Guinea undergo it. Of course, some educational efforts are directed at highlighting the harmful effects of the practice. However, in the same document, it is indicated that traditions in Guinea are persistent, and genital mutilation continues to be practised. The case law on this topic is consistent (see Annan6); in it excision is described as a cruel practice and found to be a form of persecution.\nThe issue of protection was not really argued at the hearing since the panel considers, again based on the documentation, that women subject to a risk of excision have no recourse, not only because it involves a tradition to which they cannot object, but also because no action is taken against those who contravene the Act even though genital mutilation is illegal.7\nThe possibility of an internal flight alternative does not apply in this case because, on the one hand, according to Exhibit 7.3,8 genital mutilation is practised in every region of the country and, on the other hand, it is difficult to imagine how the claimant, in view of her age, could escape her father's actions by going to live somewhere else.\nHaving said this and despite certain weaknesses in the claimant's testimony, I find that she has established that there is a reasonable chance of persecution if she returns to her country.\nDECISION\nConsequently, the Refugee Protection Division determines that XXXXXXX is a \"Convention refugee\".\nI therefore allow her claim for refugee protection.\nYves Boisrond\nMe Yves Boisrond\nJune 12, 2003\nDate\n1 Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, reads as follows:\n\"96. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,\n(a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of each of those countries; or\n(b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.\"\n2 Section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, reads as follows:\n\"97.

The couple decided to live together in July 1999. From the outset of their relationship, the claimant noted that his behaviour was violent. The verbal and physical violence was constant.\nThe claimant, who had gone through two divorces in her life, the first obtained in 1990 from the father of her two daughters, followed by a second in 1997, urged her spouse to continue in this unhealthy relationship. She wanted to have a successful relationship. She firmly believed in the idea of avoiding a third separation and she decided to remain in this brutal relationship. The claimant kept silent about the abuse that XXXXXXX inflicted on her because she [Translation] \"thought it was the price I had to pay.\" On several occasions, the violence forced the claimant to call the police who responded by going to the couple's home. Although the police had tried to persuade the claimant to make a complaint, she refused because her spouse had expressly warned her that if she had him put in prison he would take his revenge. Every time the police came, she asked XXXXX to leave the house.\nThe claimant ended the relationship. Unfortunately, XXXXXX went wherever she went and stalked, harassed and threatened the claimant at home, at work and even when she sought refugee in the village of XXXXXXXXX. She was subject to constant threats and spied on wherever she went. He even went so far as to frighten her by pretending to run her over with his car. The claimant decided that the only solution open to her was to leave the country for Canada. The claimant did so. Shortly after quitting her job in XXXXXX 2002, she packed her bags and left Costa Rica for good on XXXXXXX, 2002.\nOn XXXXXXX, 2002, some five months after her arrival, she filed a claim for refugee protection with the help of her brother who lives in Canada.\nThe claimant has alleged that she is afraid to return to her country of citizenship, Costa Rica, because XXXXX has made death threats against her and she believes he is capable of carrying them out.\nIdentity and citizenship\nThe claimant's identity and citizenship were established by a passport exhibiting the characteristics of a genuine document.\nANALYSIS\nThe panel has no doubt that the claimant lived with a man who subjected her to psychological and physical violence. However, by her actions, the claimant demonstrated an obvious lack of subjective fear. The panel finds no justification for the fact that she waited more than five months after arriving in Canada before she made a claim for refugee protection. In that regard, the claimant offered no reasonable explanation. That six months after arriving in Canada she still had it in mind to return to Costa Rica is unacceptable. If the claimant had acted within a reasonable time, she would by her alacrity have demonstrated a genuine subjective fear, which is clearly not the case here. The lack of subjective fear is doubtless not unrelated to the fact that the claimant had shown in the past that she could act to get out of a relationship that had become intolerable because of spousal abuse. The claimant was divorced for the first time in 1990 and then again in 1997. By taking such actions, the claimant demonstrated her ability to act in her own interest and towards her ultimate goal of avoiding the spousal abuse she had suffered in her previous two marriages.\nThe fact that she wanted to [Translation] \"make up for her two earlier failures\" and suffer serious abuse harmful to her self-esteem and dignity leaves us perplexed. The fact that she refused to make an official complaint against XXXXXXXX when she had not hesitated to divorce two husbands makes us wonder. That she accepted such abuse and did not respond by acting in her own best interests is questionable when it is known that on a number of occasions she asked the Costa Rican police to intervene and on each such occasion they promptly showed up at her residence, even going so far as to break down the door to take XXXXXXXX with them and prohibiting him from returning to the house or being in the vicinity.\nThe fact that the claimant refused to accept the invitation of the police officers to make a formal complaint is not unrelated to the fact that they had told her that the only recourse they could offer was therapy since they could not do anything else against an innocent man,2 meaning that he would remain innocent unless she filed a complaint. This points to and crystallizes a situation in which the claimant is relying in a sense on her own turpitude.\nOver and above these few considerations that show the claimant's lack of subjective fear and raise questions about the genuineness of her willingness to use the tools made available to her by the State to escape the violence, this claim for refugee protection raises an issue that deserves analysis, that of state protection in Costa Rica.\nThe issue of state protection was examined by the Supreme Court of Canada in Ward.3 The principle established by the Supreme Court is that, except where there has been a total breakdown of the government apparatus, a state should be presumed to be capable of protecting its citizens. The presumption can be rebutted only through \"clear and convincing\" evidence of the country's inability to ensure the protection of its citizens.\nAs well, the learned Hugessen J. held in Villafranca that\nNo government that makes any claim to democratic values for protection of human rights can guarantee the protection of all its citizen at all times. Thus, it is not enough for claimant merely to show that this government has not ?...? always been effective at protecting persons in his particular situation ?...?. 4\nIn a unanimous judgment of the Federal Court of Appeal, and I am referring here to Minal Kadenko,5 the Honourable Judge D\u00e9cary who, on behalf of the Court, in the context of a certified question, concerning protection by the Israeli government, emphasized that\nWhen the state in question is a democratic state, as in the case at bar (Israel), the claimant must do more than simply show that he or she went to see some members of the police force and that his or her efforts were unsuccessful. The burden of proof that rests on the claimant is, in a way, directly proportional to the level of democracy in the state in question: the more democratic the state's institutions, the more the claimant must have done to exhaust all the courses of action open to him or her\nIn another case,6 Heneghan J. indicated that the claimant must show that he has taken all reasonable measures in view of the situation generally prevailing in the country of origin and provide evidence of the measures that he did in fact take and his relationship with the authorities.\nThe superior courts teach that claimants are obligated to exhaust the recourses available to them. They are not required, however, to do more in seeking the protection of their country of citizenship than is objectively reasonable. Thus, they do not have to endanger their lives or jeopardize their safety by taking actions that in the circumstances would be pointless.\nA study of the documentary evidence concerning violence against women in Costa Rica and the quality of protection available within Costa Rica leads to the following conclusion:\nCosta Rica is a free and democratic country from every point of view. This finding is confirmed by the Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2002,7 which states:\nCosta Rica is a longstanding, stable, constitutional democracy with a unicameral legislative assembly directly elected in free multiparty elections every 4 years. [...] the judiciary was generally independent.\nGenerally, this document portrays Costa Rica's situation with respect to human rights as follows:\nThe government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law and judiciary provided effective means of dealing with individual instances of abuse; however, there were problems in a few areas. There were some instances of physical abuse by police and prison guards, and the judicial system processed some criminal cases very slowly, resulting in lengthy pre-trial detention for some persons charged with crimes.\nConcerning violence, Country Reports indicates:\nDomestic violence was a serious problem, and traditional patterns of unequal opportunity for women remained, despite continuing government and media efforts to advocate change.\nMore specifically, Country Reports describes the situation of women as follows:\nThe government identified domestic violence against women and children as a serious societal problem. The national institute for women (Inamu), an autonomous institution created in 1998 that is dedicated to gender equality, received 63,990 calls on its domestic abuse hot line from January through October. During this same period, Inamu counselled 4,097 female victims of abuse in its San Jose office and accepted 194 women in Inamu-run shelters. Inamu maintained 41 offices in municipalities around the country and had trained personnel working in 32 of the country's 81 cantons.\nThe office of the special prosecutor for domestic violence and sexual crimes prosecuted 448 cases related to domestic violence during the year, compared with 456 cases in 2001. Inamu reported that 24 women were killed in incidents of domestic violence during the year, compared with 11 in 2001.\nThe 1996 law against domestic violence establishes precautionary measures to help victims. At year's end, the legislative assembly was still debating a bill to qualify violence against women as a crime, which would classify certain acts of domestic violence as crimes and mandate their prosecution whether or not the victim pursued charges against the perpetrator. The authorities incorporated training on handling domestic violence cases into the basic training course for new police personnel. The domestic violence law requires public hospitals to report cases of domestic violence against women. It also denies the perpetrator possession of the family home in favour of the victim. Television coverage of this issue increased in news reporting, public service announcements, and feature programs. Reports of violence against women increased, possibly reflecting a greater willingness of victims to report abuses rather than an actual increase in instances of violence against women.\nOther documents included in the documentary evidence provide a list of organizations whose mission is to see to advancing the status of women in Costa Rica. The list of organizations provided in the documentary evidence8 leads off with the statements that\nThe following list of organizations dealing with the advancement of women and gender equity in Costa Rica was taken from the website of the directory of national organizations in charge of policies and programs for women in Latin America and the Caribbean (Directorio de organismos nacionales a cargo de las pol\u00edticas y programas para las mujeres de am\u00e9rica latina y caribe). The list is comprised of organizations active in the promotion of women's rights in 1998.\nInstituto nacional de las mujeres (national women's institute)\nThe institute is an autonomous governmental entity. It was formerly called the national centre for the development of women and the family (Centro nacional para el desarrollo de la mujer y la familia, cmf).\nObjectives:\nTo define and promote national policy for gender equality and equity;\nTo defend the rights of women;\nTo promote equality of the sexes;\nTo act as coordinator and to ensure that government bodies establish and implement a national policy for gender equality and equity;\nTo promote the full participation of women in social, political, cultural and economic life\".\nDelegaci\u00f3n de la mujer agredida (women's delegation)\nIt is accountable to the ministry of government in coordination with the national women's institute.\nObjectives and functions:\nFree help for women who have suffered physical, psychological and sexual violence, reception and processing of complaints, official protection, legal, psychological and medical assistance and referral to hostels.\nDefensor\u00eda de la mujer (office of women's affairs)\nIt is accountable to the office of public defence (defensor\u00eda de los habitantes) and the ministry of justice and pardon (ministerio de justicia y gracia)\nObjectives and functions:\nTo protect, extend and promote the rights and interests of women against violations, restrictions and discrimination arising from the actions or omissions of the public authorities;\nTo help eliminate discrimination against women by protecting and extending their rights.\nAccording to the research that had to be conducted for the documentary evidence,\nIn addition to the main activities mentioned above for the national women's institute, the Tico Times reports that the institute's national plan for the attention and prevention of domestic violence (planovi) operates two shelters for abused women in Cartago and San Jos\u00e9 (6 Aug. 1999). In one of its reports, la naci\u00f3n provided a list of resources in Costa Rica that offer services to victims of sexual violence (6 June 1999). They include the phone number of an emergency help line, which is 800-300-3000; the women's delegation (delegaci\u00f3n de la mujer), which can be reached at 222-7372 or 222-7533; offices for women's affairs in the municipalities of Alajuela, Goicoechea, Moravia, San Carlos Puntarenas and Paquera (there are 32 such offices in the country, however, not all of them are specialized in domestic violence training); social work offices in hospitals and clinics of the Costa Rican social security office Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social); and the family court (Juzgado de familia) or mixed court (Juzgado mixto) to which the victim should file a complain).\nAnother la naci\u00f3n report adds that the emergency help line called \"breaking the silence\" (rompamos el silencio) provides relevant information to the person calling, including legal orientation and emotion support, while maintaining anonymity (3 Jan. 1999). This emergency help line is staffed by 30 female volunteers and is coordinated by the \"mujer no est\u00e1s sola\" (\"woman is not alone\") program of the non-governmental organization feminist centre of information and action (centro feminista de informaci\u00f3n y acci\u00f3n, cefemina). The women's delegation, in addition to the activities mentioned above, also provides follow-up with women's complaints related to sexual violence and will accompany them through the judicial process.\nAnother initiative responding to violence against women in Costa Rica is a project financially supported by the Canadian international development agency (cida) that would facilitate the universities of Toronto and western Ontario in providing assistance for the university of Costa Rica \"to develop human resources in domestic violence prevention and intervention\" (Canadian newswire 25 Feb. 1999). The resources allocated to this project, which will run for five years, will help the university of Costa Rica \" train, for example, teachers, students, court personnel, and journalists, in how to respond to the problem of domestic violence\".\nThe following information on the services and activities of the office of women's affairs within the ombudsman's office (Defensor\u00eda de los habitantes) is additional to that mentioned above and is provided in the office's 1997-1998 annual report.\nWith regards to domestic violence, the office carried out training sessions on the contents and application of the law against domestic violence within the public sector, as well as educated public servants in overcoming the myths and stereotypes that serve as obstacles to the application of this law. Furthermore, while this law mandated the office to monitor the actions and irregularities of state officials or institutions (sujetos p\u00fablicos), the office had treated every case of domestic violence brought before it and had provided women with assistance in the preparation of making a request for protection measures through the appropriate channels (v\u00eda jurisdiccional).\nThe office continued to develop training initiatives for groups of women with emphasis on the issues that contribute to the cycle of violence, the importance of self-esteem and the legal channels available to victims of violence.\nWith regards to sexual harassment, the office wanted to organize conferences and workshops with persons, who, because of their position in the workplace, would be able to promote and disseminate the law against sexual harassment in employment and teaching (Ley contra el hostigamiento sexual en el empleo y la docencia). To that end, the office established an informal agreement with the public education ministry to facilitate the training of civil servants who were in charge of managing the application of this law and its internal regulation in the various educational institutions in the country.\nIn terms of domestic violence statistics, la naci\u00f3n states that the women's delegation (Delegaci\u00f3n de la mujer) received 12,231 complaints from January 1998 to 22 December 1998, 46 more than in the previous year. Furthermore, according to the women's delegation, the number of domestic violence cases reported and phone calls made to the emergency help line tended to increase during the Christmas holiday season (la naci\u00f3n 3 Jan. 1999). One of the help line operators stated that the increase in complaints made by women could be attributed to a greater consumption of alcohol by men.\nIn 1999, according to the national women's institute, there has been an increase in the number of cases of violence against women reported, as well as an increase in the number of women calling the emergency help line (la naci\u00f3n 10 Nov. 1999). As of 31 October 1999, the help line had received 8,729 calls, an increase from the total of 8,640 received in 1998. Of the 4,210 cases of violence against women processed by the women's delegation between January and October 1999, 2,188 were new ones. The numbers are expected to increase in the months of November and December because potential aggressors are likely to spend more time in the home and consume more alcohol. The national women's institute reports that 20 women had died as a result of aggression against them in 1999, 16 of whom were killed by their spouse or partner. At least 8 of the 20 women were on a list of passionate or conjugal homicides (Homicidos pasionales o conyugales) being investigated by the judicial investigations body (Organismo de investigaci\u00f3n judicial, oij)\".\nThis depiction of the situation of women confronting violence would be incomplete if the dimension added by another response to an information request9 were not noted. It states as follows:\nA summary of the 1996 law on domestic violence includes reference to psychological aggression by a spouse or domestic partner, but only refers to police intervention at the home where the aggression takes place and the authority to expel aggressors from the home\nEarlier, the executive submitted to congress another bill to increase the number of courts that could handle cases of domestic violence, and requested congress members to approve one of the above-mentioned bills that would penalize physical, sexual, economic and psychological aggression against women (Proyecto de ley que penaliza la agresi\u00f3n f\u00edsica, sexual, psicol\u00f3gica y patrimonial en contra de las mujeres).\nA 1999 report on the shortcomings of the law on domestic violence refers to obstacles in the legal process for effective conclusion of some cases, lack of training among many policemen, and the capability of police to expel an aggressor from the home.. The report cites the example of women who were killed by their former spouse or partner while travelling on a bus from work, and the case of a woman who repeatedly received threats from her estranged husband, with police not responding to the majority of her calls.\nFinally, another of the recourses available to women victims of violence is the divorce legislation that allows spouses to end their relationships with their partners once and for all.\nAlthough no coercive measures yet exist to put a violent spouse in prison, the 1996 domestic violence legislation10 establishes preventive measures to aid victims of domestic violence. They can ask a police officer or a judge to have the spouse excluded from the home. They may ask to have firearms seized and may request alimony and the suspension of child custody. The Act requires hospitals accepting battered women to report cases of abuse, and there is publicity about family violence on television and specialized broadcasts.\nThe national institute for women, an independent agency that deals with women victims of violence, has 41 offices in the various municipalities of Costa Rica where staff have been specially trained to respond to needs in 32 of the 81 cantons in the country. For victims of spousal abuse, there are shelters where women and their children can find refuge.\nIt should be noted that Costa Rica, which already has a free, impartial and fair justice system, has provided its legal system with a budget and measures to reduce violence against women and to provide better protection to the victims of such violence. Not only have the Costa Rican authorities, through the Minister for the status of women, expressed their readiness to support the search for solutions to violence against women and to achieve fairness, they have made laudable and significant efforts to this end.\nIn the light of the principles established by the case law and the situation that prevails in Costa Rica with regard to state protection against domestic violence, the panel finds that Costa Rica, a country that is acknowledged to be free and democratic, is presumed to be capable of protecting its citizens. It is up to the claimant to rebut the presumption through clear and convincing evidence of the government of Costa Rica's inability to ensure her protection.\nIn this respect, it should be remembered that, in his analysis, McKeon J. stated as follows:\nThe relevant evidence to determine this issue would include the documentary evidence and the personal circumstances of the claimant. The claimant's own subjective feelings on state protection would, however, not be a relevant factor [...].11\nThe claimant left her country before the government had had an opportunity to demonstrate its ability to protect her and the reliability of the tools made available to her for her protection. By refusing, whenever an opportunity arose, to file a complaint against XXXXXX, the claimant turned her back on justice by refusing the help of its officials. In short, she acted against her own interests. It seems clear that the claimant did not attempt to avail herself of all of the services available to her in Costa Rica. She closed her eyes and turned her back on all the measures that could provide safety to spousal abuse victims and offer them peace of mind.\nThe panel recalls that the duty to provide international protection becomes engaged only when the claimant cannot be ensured national or state protection. International protection is a surrogate protection.12 The claimant had a duty to choose a Costa Rican solution to her problems, which she did not do. The claimant did not provide clear and convincing evidence that the government of Costa Rica is incapable of protecting its citizens. The onus was on the claimant to rebut the presumption that the state can protect her. The claimant did not discharge the burden of proof on her.\nRemembering that the standard of protection is adequate protection13 and not effective protection14 and that the Federal Court of Appeal has held that the protection \"may be adequate though not necessarily perfect\",15 this panel has determined, after reviewing the documentary evidence and the circumstances of the case, that there is adequate protection in Costa Rica for persons who suffer spousal abuse.\nIs a reminder needed that a government cannot be expected to guarantee the protection of its citizens at all times? As well, the protection does not have to be perfect. Where a government has effective control over its territory and has an established police force at its disposal and makes serious efforts to protect its citizens, the mere fact that it is not always successful is not enough to justify the claim that victims cannot claim its protection.16\nAs a corollary to the preceding, the panel, after reviewing the evidence, finds that the claimant has not provided clear and convincing evidence that the Costa Rican government would not be capable of protecting her if she returned to her country of citizenship.\nDECISION\nFor all these reasons, the panel determines that the claimant, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, is not a \"Convention refugee\" and is not a \"person in need of protection\" under paragraphs 97(1) (a) and (b) of the Act.\nConsequently, the panel rejects her claim for refugee protection.\nMartial Guay\nMe Martial Guay\nOctober 2, 2003\nDate\n1 96. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,\n(a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or\n(b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.\n97.(1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\n(a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or\n(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\n(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\n(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\n(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.\n2 Exhibit P-3, Report of the law enforcement authorities.\n3 Canada (Attorney General) v.

The claimant arrived in Canada on January 11, 2003, and on the same day made a claim for refugee protection.\nMs. XXXXX had been required to file her Personal Information Form (PIF) no later than February 10, 2003.1\nOn January 22, 2003, the claimant appeared at the roll call and was advised of her rights and obligations, including that of filing her PIF no later than February 10, 2003. She told the registry officer that her counsel was Me Jean-Pierre Gervais.\nOn February 4, 2003, the RPD received an application for more time2 from Me J. P. Gervais, who gave the following reason for the application:\n[TRANSLATION]\n?. . .? we are requesting an extension of the time limit to give us an adequate opportunity to discuss matters with our client.\nOn February 6, 2003, the office of Me Gervais was notified that the application had been granted and that the PIF would have to be filed by no later than February 17, 2003.\nOn February 10, 2003, the Board received the Notice of Contact Information that had been signed by the claimant on February 6, 2003 from the law office of Arpin, Mascasro and Associates. In addition, Me Danielle Arpin filed her notice of appearance and made an application to extend the time limit3 for filing the PIF until February 28, 2003.\nOn February 12, 2003, Me Arpin's office was notified that previous counsel for the claimant had already made a similar application and that the time limit still applied. In other words, the PIF had to be filed by February 17, 2003.\nAs the PIF was not received, the registry officer asked the Board on February 22 to commence abandonment proceedings. The request was granted on February 26, 2003.\nMeanwhile, the claimant's PIF was filed on February 25, 2003. Since the PIF was filed after February 17, 2003, the Board continued with the abandonment proceedings on March 3, 2003.\nAt the hearing on April 16, 2003, the claimant testified that the delay was caused by her inability to contact her counsel (Me Gervais); that she had been told he was away on vacation; and that she had decided to change counsel on the same day [TRANSLATION] \"that she went to the office of Me Gervais.\"\nThe facts show that on February 4, Me Gervais made an application for extension of the time limit on behalf of his client. Furthermore, the claimant met with Me Arpin on February 6, 2003, as this was the date on which she signed the \"Notice of Contact Information\" and notified the RPD that she was the claimant's new counsel.\nThe panel is well acquainted with the claimant's first counsel, who has an excellent reputation. He is part of the office of Petit, V\u00e9zina, Gobeil and Gervais, which is an immigration legal aid office. The claimant testified that, after visiting the office of Me Gervais, she decided to change counsel out of concern that her PIF would not be filed within the time limit.\nThis explanation is surprising and not credible because, following her visit to the office of Me Gervais, the latter made an application for more time to file the PIF. If the claimant decided to change counsel, it was for some other reason.\nFurthermore, the claimant failed to inform the RPD, the Minister and Me Gervais of her decision to remove her counsel, pursuant to Rule 11.(1) and I quote:\nTo remove counsel as counsel of record, the claimant or protected person must provide written notice to the Division, to counsel and to the Minister, if the Minister is a party, that counsel is no longer counsel for the claimant or protected person.\nThis new provision has been in force since June 28, 2002, and the panel believes new counsel have an obligation to advise a claimant of the rule. It seems obvious that the new counsel did not do so, probably because the claimant failed to tell her that she had another counsel. Members regularly remind counsel during hearings that they must comply with the rules, which have now been in effect for 10 months.\nReturning to the claimant's explanations, the panel accepts that a refugee protection claimant may decide to change counsel. However, it must ensure that it is done in accordance with the rules and that if counsel accepts a new mandate in such circumstances, counsel must also be in a position to comply with the established time limit. Counsel was aware that the PIF had to be filed no later than February 17, but it was not until February 25 that she sent it to the RPD.\nFurthermore, the panel is surprised that the claimant, who changed counsel out of concern that her PIF would not be filed within the prescribed time limit, did not demonstrate as much diligence in ensuring that her new counsel filed within the time limit. Her explanations are not credible.\nAccordingly, the panel determines the claim to have been abandoned.\nJacques W. Fortier\nJacques W.

She stated that she has a well-founded fear of persecution against Ivory Coast by reason of her membership in a particular social group, namely women.\nALLEGED FACTS\nAccording to the Personal Information Form (PIF)1 submitted in support of her claim for refugee protection, the claimant was born on XXXXX, 1978. She is unmarried and she attended school from 1985 to XXXXX 1998. She then worked for her father as a sales representative from July 1998 to November 2002.\nIn her narrative at question 41, she related that, as she was returning home on XXXXX, 2002, she saw some police officers in front of her house. The neighbours informed her that her father had been arrested and her brother killed.\nThe claimant went to hide at the home of some family friends.\nAn aunt decided to have her leave the country for the United States. However, the latter informed her that she had to go to Canada because French is spoken there and it is a safe country. The panel understands that the claimant travelled with her aunt using her cousin's passport and that her aunt took back the passport when she arrived in Montreal.\nThe claimant further alleged in her narrative that when she arrived in Montreal, she met an African woman to whom she explained her problem.\nShe stated on her form that she left her country on XXXXXX, 2002, transiting through France on XXXXXX, 2002 and landing on Canadian soil the same day. The claimant did not indicate her intention to make a refugee claim until January 2003. The date of referral on the record was January 17, while other documents were established on January 9, 2003.\nANALYSIS\nFirst, the claimant is basing her claim on the ground that she is a Convention refugee because she claims to have a well-founded fear of persecution by the Ivorian authorities by reason of her membership in a particular social group, namely women.\nHaving heard the testimony and analysed the evidence, the panel determines that the claim should not be allowed because the refugee protection claimant is not credible.\nThe claimant's identity was established through her testimony. No documents to that effect were filed before the panel despite the claimant's statement that in her country, she possessed a national identity card, a birth certificate and a diploma from the business school where she took a training program. She stated that she had not taken her documents before leaving the country. The panel wanted additional details concerning the documents since information regarding the claimant's identity is greatly lacking in this case. Moreover, under section 106 of the Act and Rule 107 of the Rules, claimants are required to establish their identity. The panel will analyse the claimant's efforts to establish her identity through documents, whether issued by the Ivorian authorities or by any other local authority.\nThe claimant stated that she had not attempted to contact the business school in Africa. When asked to explain how she had left the country, the claimant stated that she had an aunt in the United States who would occasionally visit her family in Ivory Coast and who had helped her niece come to America. Given that she had travelled with her cousin's passport, we wanted to know where the passport was. The claimant stated that her aunt had taken it back when she arrived in Canada. The claimant was asked once again to specify the steps she had taken to obtain her cousin's passport in order to demonstrate that the claimant had, in fact, taken it with her when she left Ivory Coast on XXXXX, 2002. When asked to specify the efforts she had made to obtain her cousin's passport from her aunt, she stated that she had not contacted her aunt since she did not have her telephone number. The panel wanted to know what efforts she had made to contact her aunt. She indicated that she did not have her number and, therefore, could not speak with her. When informed that in America there is a directory assistance service for finding telephone numbers, she stated that she had not thought it was important. She did not ask her aunt for any information or documents that would prove that the claimant is, in fact, the person she claims to be, Fatima Diallo. Consequently, the panel is not satisfied with the claimant's explanations concerning the steps she took in attempting to establish her identity.\nMoreover, the claimant has no copy of her boarding pass or of the ticket with which she travelled. She indicated that her aunt had told her to manage on her own in order to live in Canada. When questioned as to why she had not claimed protection at the airport, the claimant stated that she had not inquired with the airport authorities.\nThe claimant stated that when she arrived in Montreal, she met a woman of African origin who referred her to the appropriate services of SARIM. The panel found this entire story regarding SARIM and the claimant's efforts very surprising in light of her statement that the day after her arrival, she went to the SARIM authorities so that they could explain how to claim protection. However, the claimant did not claim protection in Canada until January of the following year. The panel has a great deal of difficulty reconciling the fact that the claimant is afraid of the authorities in her country and left hurriedly with the help of her aunt with the fact that she did not claim the protection of the Canadian authorities upon her arrival in Canada and, moreover, took several weeks to do so.\nDespite all the explanations and opportunities offered to the claimant to establish her identity, she did not seize the opportunity to obtain documents from the aunt who had helped her travel.\nThe claimant stated that she arrived in Canada on December 19, 2002, and the hearing took place on June 17, 2003. Considering that the claimant has been in Canada for several months, the panel believes that she would have had ample time to provide documents establishing her identity, such as her national identity card or a birth certificate, which the authorities could easily provide in the country. Claimants from Ivory Coast submit these documents to the panel on a regular basis, but unfortunately, we did not receive any such documents.\nFurthermore, the panel would like to note that counsel for the claimant filed a motion during the hearing to have the panel grant a delay of a few weeks in order to file documents relating to the claimant's identity. As indicated above, the hearing took place on June 17, 2003, and the presiding member granted a one-month delay for that purpose. On July 17, 2003, counsel for the claimant wrote to the presiding member of the panel requesting an additional delay until August 1, 2003 to receive documents. It must be noted that, as of September 2, 2003, the claimant had not filed any documents. The panel finds that the initial time period granted to the claimant was fully sufficient to establish her identity, which she did not see fit to do. The panel must find that the claimant failed to produce acceptable documentation establishing identity within the meaning of section 106 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\nMoreover, the panel is of the opinion that Elazi2 applies here:\n?...? I take this opportunity to add that it is entirely reasonable for the Refugee Division to attach great importance to a claimant's passport and his air ticket. In my opinion, these documents are essential to establish the claimant's identity and his journey to come to Canada. Unless it can be assumed that a refugee status claimant is actually a refugee, it seems unreasonable to me to ignore the loss of these documents without a valid explanation. In my view, it is too easy for a claimant to simply state that he has lost these documents or the facilitator has taken them. If the Refugee Division insists on these documents being produced, the facilitators may have to change their methods.\nMinimizing the importance of the passport and air ticket as documents to be produced or ignoring their non-submission for all sorts of reasons in my opinion only serves to encourage all those whose only purpose is to take advantage of a system which is intended solely to enable genuine refugees to come to Canada.\nThe claimant may be of Ivorian origin; however, the panel does not know where she comes from, where she has lived, how long she lived there or what status she had. The panel does not know whether the claimant is a citizen of Ivory Coast or a citizen or permanent resident of another country. The panel does not know when she left her country or the route she followed in coming to Canada.\nThe claimant did not compensate for the lack of documents intended to establish her citizenship by obtaining independent corroboration of the citizenship she alleged she had obtained. She returned the passport as well as the airplane ticket with which she had travelled to her aunt in the United States. This act deprives the panel of important and relevant documents that would at least have corroborated the claimant's testimony concerning the route she took from Ivory Coast to Canada.\nSince the panel does not know where the claimant comes from or where she has lived and with what status, it is not required to pursue its analysis of this claim for refugee protection any further, since she has failed to discharge the burden on her of establishing that she is a citizen of Ivory Coast.\nThe panel accordingly relies on a decision of the Federal Court rendered on March 10, 2003 by No\u00ebl J. in Abdul Basher Bhuiyan.3\nCONCLUSION\nIn light of the foregoing, the panel determines that the claimant, XXXXXXX, is not a Convention refugee under section 964 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nThe panel further determines that the claimant is not a person in need of protection under paragraphs 97(1)(a) and (b)5 and that there is no credible basis under subsection 107(2) of the Act.\nConsequently, the panel rejects the claim.\nMichel Jobin\nMe Michel Jobin\nSeptember 16, 2003\nDate\n1 Exhibit P-1, PIF.\n2 Elazi, Iseikete Simon v.

(F.C.T.D., IMM-53-02), No\u00ebl, March 10, 2003.\n4 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, reads in part as follows:\n96. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,\n(a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or\n(b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.\n5 97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\n(a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or\n(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\n(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\n(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\n(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - IDENTITY - DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE - CREDIBILITY - WOMAN - NEGATIVE - IVORY COAST\n---------------\n---------------\n---------------\n---------------\nNo. dossier SPR \/ RPD file #: MA3-00563\n6\n",

She is divorced from her first husband, and she remarried in Canada with a Canadian citizen in XXXX 2002. She has two minor sons living with her ex-husband in Mombassa, in Kenya. The claimant is of Ismaili Muslim religion and of Asian origin.\nThe claimant met her first husband, XXXXX (citizen of Kenya), in Tanzania in 1984, against her parents' will. The couple moved to Mombassa, in Kenya, and soon after, to Zaire. In 1998, they went to the United States on a visit, and they stayed there for ten years. The claimant's husband obtained a work permit; however, the claimant did not have any legal status in the United States.\nThe couple has two sons, one born in Tanzania in 1986, and another one born in the United States in 1989. From the beginning of their marriage, the claimant's husband was violent and abusive. He would slap the claimant and threaten her with a knife when they argued. The claimant tried to obtain some help and support from her religious community, and on one occasion, she even called the police. Her husband was also unfaithful to her.\nIn 1999, the claimant's ex-husband decided to return to Africa. He left the claimant with her parents in Tanzania, while he himself returned to Mombassa. In 1999, he tried to obtain a divorce from her. The claimant did not want to divorce, because she did not have any means to support herself and her children. The claimant would come to Mombassa from time to time to help her ex-husband with the children, and then she would return to her parents in Tanzania.\nIn 1999 in Kenya, the claimant's ex-husband married another woman. When the claimant protested, he mistreated her and told her to leave. In XXXXX 2000, the claimant's husband sent her and her younger son to Canada. The claimant was supposed to help her husband's ailing grandmother in Toronto. The claimant decided to take that opportunity and not to return to her husband. In October 2001, she asked for refugee status in Canada.\nWhile the claimant was in Canada, her husband obtained the divorce in XXXXX 2001. In XXXXX 2002, the claimant married a Canadian citizen in Toronto.\nShould she go back to Tanzania, the claimant is afraid that her ex-husband will abuse her, as he has done in the past. She is also afraid that he will find her in Tanzania and kill her, because she remarried and because she is happy with her new husband.\nDETERMINATION\nAfter hearing the claimant's testimony and evaluating all the evidence in this case, I have come to the conclusion that the claimant is not a \"Convention refugee\"1 nor a \"person in need of protection\",2 for the reasons which follow.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\nIn order to establish her identity, the claimant submitted her Tanzanian passport and several other ID and personal documents. Based on that evidence, I conclude that the claimant has established her identity.\nCredibility\nIn the analysis of this claim, I took into consideration the Chairperson's Guidelines concerning gender-related claims.\nHowever, I rejected the claimant's testimony as generally not credible. Also, her behaviour contradicts her alleged fear of persecution.\nThe claimant alleges that her ex-husband was violent and abusive during their marriage, and that he used to have regular extramarital relations. However, the claimant stayed with him because she did not have any other choice. She also wanted to keep the family together, because of her children. All that is plausible. I can also accept as plausible that even though her husband was allegedly mistreating her and had other women, for the same reasons as stated above, the claimant contested, in 1999, a divorce which her husband had obtained. She was helped by the Ismaili community in Nairobi, who paid for the lawyer and for the procedure, and her complaint was accepted in XXXXX 1999 by Tanzania's Attorney General. The claimant continued her life with her husband, travelling back and forth between her parents in Tanzania and her husband and children in Kenya, until she came to Canada in September 2000.\nIt is not clear for me, from the evidence on hand and from the claimant's testimony, if her husband had obtained a divorce in 1999, which was later invalidated, or if he just had to start a divorce procedure all over again. What we know for sure is that the claimant's ex-husband was finally able to divorce her on XXXXX, 2001, when the claimant was already in Canada. According to the claimant's testimony, her ex-husband promptly married another woman. It was impossible to establish, from the claimant's very confused and contradictory testimony, when she had learned about that divorce. However, what appears from the Toronto lawyer's letter3 is that the claimant was still not ready to accept the divorce.\nAs the claimant testified, her only wish when she came to Canada was allegedly to get rid of her abusive husband, obtain security, and start a new life. Despite that, she did not hesitate to spend money on an allegedly expensive lawyer in order to enquire in Kenya about the validity of her husband's divorce. In the letter, dated XXXXX, 2001, sent to Kenya by the claimant's Toronto attorney, the motive given for the inquiry was that the claimant wanted to establish if she was free to marry in Canada without committing bigamy. However, according to her testimony, at that time, she did not plan to remarry, and she only met her second husband several months later, in XXXXX 2001. The claimant could not reasonably explain why she would spend her scarce resources for lawyer's fees in order to establish if her husband had really obtained a legal divorce. I believe that the claimant did not want to accept the divorce and was still decided to contest it, if possible. That is not compatible with her testimony that after she came to Canada, her only wish was to obtain protection and security away from her abusive husband.\nAs for her ex-husband, it is clear to me that at least starting in the summer of 1999, after the couple returned to Africa, he wanted to divorce the claimant and marry somebody else, which he eventually did. I do not believe, in the circumstances, that if the claimant returns to Tanzania, her husband would want to kill her because it brought shame on him in the eyes of the Ismaili community and because he does not want the claimant to be happy. From the evidence in this case, it is rather clear that the claimant's ex-husband wanted badly to get out of the marriage and that the claimant did everything she could to prevent that. I find it implausible that once legally divorced and remarried, and in the situation where the claimant herself is now legally married to another man, her husband would try to harm her, as she alleges. That simply does not make sense.\nMore so, according to the claimant's testimony, her community in the United States, in Kenya, in Tanzania, and in Toronto has been informed of the claimant's marital problems for years, and has even assisted her in paying the lawyer in Nairobi in order to oppose the divorce. Even then, her husband did not kill her, despite the fact that after contesting his divorce, the claimant came back to Mombassa on several occasions to stay with him and with her sons. I find it implausible that he would want to kill her now.\nMy conclusion is strongly reinforced by the claimant's behaviour after she came to Canada. It is incompatible with her alleged fear of persecution. The claimant testified that her objective after she came to Canada was to find security for herself and her son, whom she brought along with her. However, six months after they came to Canada, she sent the boy back to her allegedly abusive husband, who in the meantime remarried and, according to the claimant's testimony, in order to be alone with his new wife, sent away his other son to live with strangers in the United States. Asked to explain why, in the circumstances, she sent her son back to her ex-husband, the claimant stated that she did not have the choice, because she did not have the financial means to keep him in Canada. I find this explanation not plausible. Not only the claimant has her community which was allegedly supporting her from the beginning, not only she was able to find resources to pay an expensive lawyer in order to do the procedures against her ex-husband, but also, she simply could have asked for Canada's protection, and therefore obtain financial support from the Canadian government for her and her son. She did not do so. Instead, she sent her son back to Kenya. I do not find it plausible that the claimant would have done so if her story of an abusive husband were true.\nThe claimant came to Canada in September 2000. She testified that she was granted a six-month visitor's visa. Two months after she arrived, the claimant contacted a lawyer, Mr. Guidy Mamann, from a law firm, Mamann & Associates, Immigration Lawyers, in Toronto. It was in November 2000. Mr. Mamann is the same lawyer who, in 2001, applied for her six-month visa extension and, in XXXXX 2001, assisted her in making her refugee claim. The claimant testified that from the beginning, she had told Mr. Mamann about her marital problems, and that she wanted to obtain security in Canada. However, despite that, Mr. Mamann told her that she should first extend her visitor's visa for another six months, and only advised her to make a refugee claim in October 2001, when she was illegally in Canada for already one month. I find her testimony patently implausible. I do not believe that a specialized immigration law firm in Toronto, which eventually assisted the claimant in making her refugee claim, would not have done so immediately after the claimant informed them about her problems with her husband and about her desire to seek security in Canada. I believe instead that the claimant was still hoping to go back to Kenya to her husband, and that she decided to remain in Canada only when her husband finally divorced her and married another woman. I do not believe that she stayed in Canada because she needed protection.\nIn conclusion, even if I accepted that the claimant's husband might have been abusive and violent during their life together, I do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that he would try to harm her should she go back to Tanzania, more so, since the claimant's husband does not live in Tanzania, but in Kenya. The counsel for the claimant argued that besides the danger from her husband, she cannot go back to Tanzania because there, she does not have the family and community support necessary to re-establish herself. Also, according to the counsel, based on the documentary evidence, women, people of Asian origin, and Shia minority, to which the claimant belongs, are discriminated against in Tanzania by the Sunni majority and by the government. However, no evidence was submitted to the tribunal that such discrimination in Tanzania would amount to persecution, or that it would have prevented the claimant from successfully re-establishing herself in that country. As for the family and community support, I do not believe the claimant's testimony that she could not live with her parents. She did so in 1999 and 2000. As for the Ismaili community in Tanzania, which has been shrinking in size in recent years, the claimant confirmed what is known to the tribunal (specialized knowledge), that the Ismaili communities around the world, regardless of their size, are very close by knit and supportive to their members. I believe that in the circumstances, the claimant would be able to live a normal life should she go back to Tanzania, and that she could live there without a serious possibility of harm from her ex-husband.\nDECISION\nConsidering all the above, I conclude that the claimant, Mrs. XXXXXXX XXXXXX XXXXXXX, has not established a well-founded fear of persecution in Tanzania. Therefore, she is not a \"Convention refugee\", as per Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. For the same reasons, I conclude that she is not a \"person in need of protection\", as per Section 97(1) of the same Act.\nBarbara Berger\nBarbara Berger\nOctober 7, 2003\nDate\n\/jcbo\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - WOMEN REFUGEES - GENDER - PARTICULAR SOCIAL GROUP - DOMESTIC VIOLENCE - GENDER-RELATED PERSECUTION - CREDIBILITY - FEMALE - NEGATIVE - TANZANIA\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C.

She also alleges, for the same reasons, that she would be subject personally to a risk to her life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment and that she would be subject personally to a danger of torture within the meaning of the Convention Against Torture.\nThe evidence on the record consists of the claimant's testimony and the exhibits filed by her counsel as Exhibits P-1 to P-3. In addition, the refugee protection officer adduced Exhibits A-1 to A-5 on the record. The claimant's testimony and her Personal Information Form reveal the following facts.\nTHE FACTS\nThe claimant was born in Liberia in the province of Guanacaste in Costa Rica on XXXXX, 1983.\nThe claimant alleged that she became a member of the National Liberation Party when she was nine years old and that, following her studies from 1989 to XXXXX 2001, she campaigned with the party until the 2002 presidential elections.\nAccording to her testimony and her Personal Information Form, she worked from XXXX 2001 to XXXX 2003 except for a period of approximately one month between 2001 and 2002 when she was obliged to quit her job because of her sexual orientation - that is, the fact that she is a lesbian. She related to the panel as a ground of persecution the fact that the Social Christian Unity Party had denounced her sexual orientation in 1998 in order to harm her and that she had subsequently been insulted by people who knew her. She further stated that some members of her party, the National Liberation Party, had asked her to leave.\nShe also related that she had tried to obtain a bursary at a private university in San Jos\u00e9 and that there had been no response to her application. She further alleged that she had lost two jobs because of her sexual orientation.\nFinally, she related that she was afraid to go out alone and that she had been treated roughly by groups of young people or citizens of Costa Rica.\nThe claimant obtained her passport on XXXXXXX, 2002 and in XXXXXX 2002, she moved to XXXX, where she decided leave her country, which she did on XXXXX, 2003. She arrived in Canada on that same date and made a claim for refugee protection on February 5, 2003.\nANALYSIS\nThe panel is satisfied of the claimant's identity, which is supported by her testimony and by her passport, which is among the documents filed as Exhibit A-2, the passport being acceptable documentation in the panel's opinion.\nThe panel listened carefully to the claimant's testimony and also consulted the whole of the documentary evidence filed on the record by both the claimant and the refugee protection officer.\nThe claimant is basing her fear of returning on the fact that she could be subject to threats by members of the Social Christian Unity Party who previously attacked candidates for the presidency of the National Liberation Party, namely Rolando Araya.\nThe claimant's testimony is not supported by the documentary evidence, including Exhibits A-3 and A-4, which indicate that members of the Social Christian Unity Party did not perpetrate any violence, threats, intimidation or harassment against members of the National Liberation Party, other than the incidents experienced by Rolando Araya following the second round of elections on or around April 8, 2002.\nThe panel further notes that, according to the documentary evidence,1 Costa Rica has enjoyed a long and stable tradition of constitutional democracy and that it has an independent judicial system providing effective means for dealing with cases of individual violence.\nThe panel finds that the claimant failed to discharge the burden of proof on her with respect to her fear by reason of her political opinion or her political activities and that, consequently, there is not a reasonable chance that she will be persecuted for this reason should she return to her country, Costa Rica.\nThe claimant is also basing her claim on her sexual orientation - that is, on the fact that she is a lesbian and was therefore subjected to persecution by certain members of her party who had asked her to leave the party and by groups of young people and citizens who had threatened and insulted her, on the fact that she had lost and been turned down for jobs, and finally on the fact that she had been unable to obtain a bursary from a university in San Jos\u00e9.\nOn the latter point, the claimant testified that when she was in Liberia, she had applied for a bursary from a university in San Jos\u00e9 and had not received a reply. The claimant inquired about what had happened to her application and was told that it had been sent to San Jos\u00e9. When she inquired at the university, she was informed that they had not received her application. Following this, the university officials and those in Liberia kept refusing to accept responsibility regarding the claimant's bursary application.\nWhen asked whether she had submitted a second application, the claimant stated that she had not done so and that she assumed that the university she wanted to attend was a highly renowned university and that the fact that she is a lesbian could have tarnished the university's image.\nOn that point, the panel finds that, since the claimant did not attempt to clarify exactly what had happened and did not attempt to submit a second application, she failed to discharge the burden on her of proving that the fact that she had not obtained a bursary was a result of her sexual orientation. The claimant had put forth the hypothesis that the people in Liberia, being aware of her sexual orientation, had not forwarded her application because this would have harmed the university and because starting to send gays and lesbians to the university would make it a haven for them, which would be detrimental to the university's prestige.\nWhen asked whether she had filed a complaint, the claimant stated that she had not done so over this. This portion of the claimant's testimony is not supported by the documentary evidence, in particular Exhibit A-5, which reports a communication with the director of the centre for the promotion of human rights in Central America, an organization that operates in Costa Rica. The director indicated that she was not aware of any cases in which a female student has been turned down for a university bursary because of her sexual orientation but that such an application could be possible at a private university. The same exhibit also indicates that a refusal to award a bursary to a student because of his or her sexual orientation would be considered discriminatory in Costa Rica, that the person could file a complaint with the Office of the Ombudsman and that no complaint of this type has been made at that office.\nConsequently, the panel determines that the claimant failed to discharge the burden of proof on her on this point and that there is not a reasonable chance that she will be persecuted should she return to Costa Rica by reason of the fact that she was allegedly turned down for a bursary because of her sexual orientation.\nWith respect to the other facts on which the claimant is basing her claim for refugee protection, the panel is of the opinion that they do not constitute acts of persecution in themselves, but rather discriminatory practices. The panel is also of the opinion that the primary issue is whether the State of Costa Rica is able to offer the claimant protection.\nIn conducting this assessment, the panel took into account the claimant's written and oral testimony as well as the whole of the evidence that was submitted and the representations of both the refugee protection officer and counsel for the claimant. The panel also considered the whole of the documentary evidence regarding sexual minorities and the complaints they can make and the recourse available to them to end the violence or discrimination to which they are subjected.\nThe documentary evidence, in particular Exhibit A-2, section 7.1 ff., and Exhibit A-2, sections 4.1 and 4.2, reveals the following.\nCosta Rica has a flourishing homosexual community that is not the target of systemic persecution by the authorities or by society at large.\nThere are holiday resorts, businesses and organizations that welcome homosexuals in Costa Rica, and there are numerous Web sites for this community that compile the information available on homosexual advocacy groups and that indicate levels of tolerance or describe incidents that have taken place in the country.\nThere are also a large number of publications and many associations aimed at homosexuals.\nAs well, there are many homosexual organizations and a community newspaper.\nAccording to the Director of the Agua Buena Human Rights Association in San Jos\u00e9, Richard Stern, a clinical psychologist and former leader of the now defunct gay organization Tri\u00e1ngulo Rosa, Costa Rica has a \"live and let live\" attitude towards homosexuals, and discrimination is not a government or police policy. Mr. Stern indicated that, depending on their family, their school, their church or the community in which they live, gay adolescents may experience difficulties until they are able to accept their sexual identity. He also indicated that in 1997, the Supreme Court outlawed bar raids and ordered that the government provide new AIDS medication to 500 people, most of them gay men.\nThis documentary evidence also reveals that the residents of Costa Rica in 1998, in response to a speech made against gay festivals and gay tourism in Costa Rica, the President was criticized for his behaviour by the Office of the Ombudsman, who stated that he had violated the law by making this type of comment against gays and lesbians.\nThis documentary evidence also reveals that the candidates in the presidential elections, Antonio Dos Santis and Miguel Corales, have both been interviewed by the gay press and indicated that they uphold a position of balance and respect toward the gay and homosexual or lesbian community.\nThe documentary evidence also reveals that individuals who have a distinct sexual preference enjoy the protection of various organizations, including the Office of the Ombudsman and the Constitutional Court, which can assist them in protecting their rights if those rights are threatened. As well, there are a number of non-governmental organizations, including the Centre for Research and Promotion of Human Rights in Central America (CIPAC), Agua Buena, Movimiento 5 de Abril and the Latin American Institute of Health Education and Prevention, all of which work to protect sexual minorities and their rights.\nAlthough the decisions of the Office of the Ombudsman are not binding, as it is the State that decides whether its recommendations should be accepted, the panel finds that this does not detract in any way from the efficacy of the Office of the Ombudsman since its role is to investigate cases of serious violence and to refer cases to the Public Prosecutor.\nThere is no persuasive evidence before the panel that the Public Prosecutor does not prosecute cases of misconduct or abuse of authority complaints from sexual minorities. The panel further notes that, according to the documentary evidence consulted, decisions made by the Ombudsman are legally binding.\nThe documentary evidence consulted, in particular Exhibit A-2, section 7.4, which is a response to a request bearing number CRI140017, also refers to various types of recourse that are available to members of sexual minorities who have been the victims of various forms of discrimination or violence. For example, it indicates that a person who has been the victim of extortion or blackmail by police officers can lodge a complaint with the Ministry of Security. Second, a person detained without a warrant issued by a judge can submit a writ of habeas corpus to the Constitutional Court, and any person who considers that he has been unjustly detained or that his or her physical integrity has been threatened may present a writ of habeas corpus against the authority responsible for this violation of his or her rights. Third, a person who has been the victim of discrimination in the workplace can file a complaint with the Minister of Labour. Fourth, a person who has been denied health services or medications may lodge a recourse of amparo before the Constitutional Court to obtain protection. Fifth, a person who has experienced the violation of a right not covered by the writ of habeas corpus or who has been threatened by another person, an authority or an institution may also lodge a recourse of amparo before the Constitutional Court. Finally, a victim of physical violence must file a complaint with the Judicial Investigative Police.\nIn light of all the documentary evidence, the panel is of the opinion that the Costa Rican government is making serious efforts to protect all its citizens, including sexual minorities.\nWhen confronted with the documentary evidence, the claimant stated that she had filed a complaint with the police regarding the threats to which she had been subject but that there had been no witnesses to identify the young people in question. She also stated that she had refused to make a formal written complaint and had been told to keep a closer watch on people who might threaten or insult her.\nShe further stated that she had not filed a complaint with the Office of the Ombudsman. She subsequently indicated with respect to the whole of the evidence, that the information we have from Costa Rica indicating that the country is democratic and that there are remedies is not true since she has experienced problems. She stated that all of these fine laws and citations are not applied in reality.\nShe later stated that she did not believe that the people who had reported this documentary evidence were telling the truth because there are many pages on the Internet that tell of people who have reported instances in which the law was not applied and that she herself knew how things happened.\nBased on all the foregoing, the panel is of the opinion that, given the various remedies available to the claimant in the event of violence or misconduct by citizens or by her employers, the claimant failed to provide any persuasive reason to justify her lack of effort in seeking state protection. The panel is also of the opinion that the claimant should have taken advantage of the options available to her by reporting the discrimination she had experienced to either the Ombudsman, the Ministry of Security, the Constitutional Court or an organization working to defend the rights of homosexuals and lesbians in Costa Rica.\nCosta Rica has enjoyed a long and stable tradition of constitutional democracy and has an independent judicial system providing effective means for dealing with cases of individual violence.\nThe more democratic the state's institutions, the more the claimant must have done to exhaust all the courses of action open to him or her.2\nThere is no persuasive evidence that the State of Costa Rica would have been unwilling to protect the refugee protection claimant if she had exhausted the available remedies by contacting the organizations the State made available to her.\nThe panel considered the claimant's allegation that she had lost two jobs because of her sexual orientation. However, the panel notes that the refugee protection claimant worked almost continuously from XXXXXX 2001 until her departure in XXXXX 2003, as indicated in her response to question 18 on her Personal Information Form, which attests to a degree of stability in the claimant's employment.\nFinally, the result of this is that there is no persuasive evidence to establish that the refugee protection claimant was the victim of discrimination constituting persecution and of discrimination in the workplace because of her sexual orientation. Moreover, if she had been dismissed or had not been paid for this reason, she had the option of filing a complaint with either the Ombudsman or the Ministry of Labour.\nIn assessing the evidence, the panel also considered the refugee protection claimant's allegation that she was afraid of the discrimination and physical violence that could be inflicted on her by young people and by society at large, which is homophobic. However, the refugee protection claimant failed to present persuasive evidence pertaining to her case, other than four insults and threats she allegedly received from young persons or individuals, to suggest that the discrimination of which she was the victim constituted persecution by society. On the contrary, the panel finds that this constituted discrimination, that in Costa Rica the homosexual and lesbian population is not the target of systemic persecution by society and that, consequently, the claimant's fear of society is not objectively well founded.\nAccordingly, given that the State of Costa Rica is able to protect the refugee protection claimant, the panel determines that the claimant failed to discharge the burden of proof on her, that there is not a reasonable chance that she will be persecuted should she return to her country, Costa Rica, for one of the grounds set out in the Convention, and that she is not a person in need of protection under section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nCONCLUSION\nConsequently, the panel determines that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is not a Convention refugee under section 96 of the Act or a person in need of protection under section 97 of the Act.\nThe claim for refugee protection is rejected.\nMichel Venne\nMichel Venne\nSeptember 23, 2003\nDate\n1 Exhibit A-2, sections 4.1 and 4.2.\n2 Kadenko v.

He is Sunni Muslim and has twelve years of formal education. His parents and four siblings currently live in Pakistan. The claimant is separated from his American wife. The claimant has approximately twenty years of work experience in the hotel industry. He bases his claim to Convention Refugee status and request for Refugee Protection on the grounds of his membership in a particular social group. Specifically, he fears for his life at the hands of Muslim extremists in Pakistan because he is a homosexual.\nTHE HEARING\nEvidence adduced at the hearing included the claimant's Personal Information Form (PIF)1 as well as his oral testimony. In support of his claim, he deposited personal identity and background documents as well as background documentation on the situation for homosexuals in Pakistan. The Refugee Protection Officer deposited the Country Binder Indexes as well as background information on the human rights on political situation in Pakistan. The RPO also deposited personal information about the claimant provided by Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC). As per the claimant's wishes, the hearing was conducted in English without the services of an interpreter. He confirmed at the hearing that he is fluent in English and did not require documentation to be translated to him to another language.\nFACTS AND ISSUE\nThe following is a summary of the allegations provided in the claimant's PIF narrative. The claimant refuses to return to Pakistan because of his homosexual orientation. Homosexuality is prohibited by Islamic Religious Laws and by the Secular Laws of the country.\nThe claimant became aware of his sexual orientation between 1987 and 1989 working in Saudi Arabia. Although attracted to another man, the claimant did not develop a relationship with him at that time. The claimant returned to Pakistan in 1989 and decided not to return to Saudi Arabia. The claimant's first gay relationship was in 1993 with XXXXXXXX. When the relationship was discovered by the family of his friend, they forced his friend to stop coming to work and informed the claimant's parents about the relationship. They also threatened to kill the claimant if he attempted to see XXXXXX again. At this point, the claimant's father threw him out of the house and the claimant lived on his own from 1994. The claimant left that job to avoid further embarrassment. In 1995, the claimant had his second relationship and the two men start living together. When his lover's family found out, three men from the village attacked them and warned them about seeing each other. They separated for a while but moved back together again. They stayed together until 1998 when his partner decided to leave.\nThe claimant had another male lover in 2000 and again, when the partner's family found out, the claimant was threatened. When his partner's father threatened to tell the local Moulvi if the claimant attempted to see his son again, the claimant promised he would not.\nAt this point, the claimant began to consider leaving Pakistan. The claimant applied for visas at the Canadian Embassy but was refused. He obtained the U.S. visa and entered the United States on August 3rd, 2001. After the events of September 11th, 2001 in New York City, the claimant was afraid to claim in the United States. He met a woman who used to frequent a restaurant where he was working. She agreed to marry him so that he could get immigration papers. After living together for three months, the woman left the house and decided to withdraw the sponsorship and apply for separation. The claimant, then, came to Canada on February 24th, 2003 at the Lacolle border crossing. He requested Refugee Status at that time.\nDETERMINATION\nAfter reviewing all the evidence adduced, I find that the claimant has met the burden which his to establish with credible and trustworthy evidence that he has a well-founded fear of persecution in Pakistan. I am aware that statements given under oath or solemn declaration are considered true, unless there is good reason to doubt the veracity of the statements. There are parts of the claimant's testimony that I found weak and to not satisfactorily answer questions put to him. However, in general, I found his overall testimony on the central elements of his claim to be direct, spontaneous and generally credible.\nANALYSIS\nThe claimant alleges that he is a citizen of Pakistan. In support of his claim, he deposited personal identity documents including a national identity card as Exhibit P-32. He also deposited several personal background documents. Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) provided a photocopy of the claimant's passport. The Minister has not intervened in this case with regards to the claimant's identity. No evidence raising doubts about the claimant's identity as a citizen of Pakistan has been put forward. On the evidence before me and on the balance of probabilities, I accept the claimant's identity as a citizen of Pakistan.\nThe claimant bases his fear of return to Pakistan on the fact that he is a homosexual. I found his testimomy to be generally credible. He related his testimony to incidents included in his PIF without major inconsistencies or contradictions. He responded to questions about his marriage to XXXXXXXXXX in the United States, spontaneously. Although he deposited no documentary evidence to confirm that he is separated from his wife, based on his uncontradicted testimony, I find that the marriage was one of convenience designed to attempt to secure his status in the United States without having to declare his sexual orientation.\nI found his testimony about his reasons for not seeking refugee protection or asylum in the United States during a year and a half that he was there to be less reliable. He arrived in the United States prior to the events in New York and Washington on September 11, 2001. I found his explanations for delaying seeking protection to be consistent with his alleged fear. However, I believe at that point, he was more motivated by the prospect of working and staying in the United States than seeking protection from going home to Pakistan. This was only reinforced by his marriage of convenience to XXXXXXXXXX.\nHowever, my decision in this claim is not based on the fact that the claimant did not claim in the United States. On the balance of probabilities and on the evidence before me, I believe that the claimant is a homosexual.\nThe documentary evidence in Exhibit A-33 indicates that homosexuality remains outlawed in Pakistan and that penalties differ from two years to life in prison and or flogging. The same document also states that under Islamic Law, the penalties can include death by stoning\nIn Exhibit A-44 at section 6.170, we read the following:\n\"Homosexuality is widely practised in Pakistan although there are no statistics available to quantify this. Section 377 of the Penal Code makes criminal carnal knowledge of any man against the order of nature, with a penalty of two years to life imprisonment and the possibility of corporal punishment of 100 lashes. Homosexuality is considered immoral but is tolerated in many parts of the country. It is disapproved of and would be considered unlawful and unislamic by most Pakistanis. Known homosexuals are said to become social outcasts. Whilst it would be possible to have homosexual relations discretely it would be extremely difficult to live openly as a homosexual couple although much would depend on the social position of the couple and the attitude of the families\".\nIn this claim, I have accepted the claimant's testimony as credible. He has testified to events where his life was threatened and where he could not reasonably expect the protection of the police. I believe that the evidence before me in this claim establishes that there is more than a mere possibility that the claimant would be at risk of persecution if he were to return to Pakistan. Without a reasonable level of state protection, I do not see an internal flight alternative as being reasonable in this claim.\nTherefore, after reviewing all of the evidence adduced, I find that the claimant is a \"Convention Refugee\" as defined in Section 965 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and I, hereby, accept his request for \"Refugee Protection\".\nLawrence Lang\nLawrence Lang\nAugust 12th, 2003\nDate\n\/gl\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - PARTICULAR SOCIAL GROUP - SEXUAL ORIENTATION - HOMOSEXUALS - MALE - POSITIVE - PAKISTAN\n1 Exhibit P-1 : Personal Information Form (PIF) of the claimant.\n2 Exhibit P-3 : National Identity Card.\n3 Exhibit A-3 : Montreal Regional Binder Index\/Cartable r\u00e9gional de Montr\u00e9al.

They also allege that they could be personally subject to a risk to their lives or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if they returned to Mexico.\nALLEGED FACTS\nEvidence in this case was presented by the claimants, their counsel, the Department of Citizenship and Immigration, and the Board. The evidence consisted of the following: the claimants' Personal Information Forms (PIFs), their oral testimonies, their identity documents, personal papers and documents on the socio-political and human rights situation in Mexico. The claimants' PIFs and their oral testimonies revealed the following facts.\nThe three claimants were born and lived mainly in the Federal District of Mexico. The XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX couple said in their PIFs that they had married in 1997 and had no children. The other claimant had married in 1982 and had three children aged 5, 15 and 20. His children and their mother were still in Mexico. The three claimants said they had never had any problems in Mexico before XXXX 2003, when they were working together in a hardware store in suburban Mexico City. The claimant XXXXXXXXXXX lived with the other claimants during the week and went home on the weekends to Ecatepec, Mexico state.\nThe three claimants based their claims for refugee protection on the alleged fact that they had been indirect witnesses to a murder on the night of XXXXX to XXX, 2003, when neighbours involved in drug trafficking allegedly killed a prostitute. Ms. XXXXXXXXXX explained that as she and the other claimants were coming home from supper at a restaurant, they were about to go into their apartment when they saw a prostitute fighting with two of their neighbours. The prostitute called one of them a \"damn drug dealer,\" before she was forced into the neighbours' apartment. The neighbours, according to the claimant, had noticed that the claimants had seen everything that happened.\nOnce inside their apartment, the claimants said they heard a woman screaming, followed by two gunshots and then complete silence. Ms. XXXXXXXXXXX allegedly took the initiative of calling the police, although she did not identify herself. Two uniformed, armed police officers allegedly showed up at the neighbours' apartment an hour later. The claimants, who were watching from their own apartment, were surprised to see the police officers chatting with the neighbours as if they were friends. Twenty minutes later, Mr. XXXXXXXXX saw through the peek hole of their apartment door the two police officers and the two neighbours carrying out a black bag with a person's body in it, or at least what looked like a person's body, according to the narratives in the claimants' PIFs.\nTen minutes later, around three in the morning on XXXXXX, 2003, the police officers and two neighbours allegedly burst into the claimants' apartment, the police officers pointing their guns at them. The claimants were allegedly warned that they would suffer the same fate as the prostitute if they did not keep their mouths shut about what had happened. The drug trafficking neighbours were quick to point out that they had friends on the police force. The claimants allegedly went to the police station in Iztapalapa at 9 am the same day but decided not to file a complaint when the officer on duty told them what kind of evidence was required-the names and pictures of the criminals and the police officers, for example-to start an investigation and give them immediate protection.\nThe claimants let their families know what had happened and went back to their apartment. In the wee hours of the morning on XXXXXX, 2003, the drug trafficking neighbours again allegedly burst into their apartment, this time with two strangers who said they were officers of the judicial police wearing civilian clothes. The four men allegedly beat up the claimants, threatened to kill them, and told them to get out of the country within 24 hours, because they had gone to the police. After being treated at a clinic, the claimants allegedly drove to the city of Manuel Doblado (Guanajuato), six hours from their apartment, where they remained in hiding until they left the country.\nThe claimants left Mexico by plane on April 5, 2003, and landed the same day in Canada. They apparently indicated their intention to claim refugee protection ten days later. The claimants said they were afraid for their lives if they had to go to anywhere in Mexico, because they would be at the mercy of drug traffickers and corrupt police officers, who do what they want with complete impunity.\nThese in substance are the facts brought to the panel's attention by the claimants, who were the only ones to testify in this case. The panel must decide whether they are Convention refugees1 and\/or persons in need of protection2 within the meaning of sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nANALYSIS\nThe in-depth analysis of all of the evidence adduced, both testimony and documentary evidence, leads the panel to find that the claimants discharged the burden that was on them of demonstrating they would be subject to a risk to their lives or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if they were to return to Mexico. The panel reached this finding for several reasons, the main ones of which follow.\nThe panel had the opportunity to observe the attitude of Ms. XXXXXXXXX, the principal witness in this case, and to note that overall she testified with spontaneity and frankness and without exaggeration. The other two claimants agreed with her testimony. The panel did not notice any contradiction between her testimony, the narrative in her PIF and the statements she and her husband made to the immigration officer on April 24, 2003, about two weeks after they arrived in Canada.\nMs. XXXXXXXXXX explanation for why she did not testify spontaneously about what she had written in her PIF narrative, namely that her drug trafficking neighbours had clearly seen her and the other claimants while they were fighting with the prostitute-the reason they allegedly burst into their apartment after the prostitute's murder-was weaker. The same holds for her explanation for why she and the other claimants did not give the address of their drug trafficking and murdering neighbours to the officer at the Iztapalapa police station. The panel finds that these flaws are not fatal, and in light of the evidence taken as a whole, the panel gives the benefit of the doubt to the claimants as to their story's credibility.\nThe claimants' story is backed up by the extensive documentary evidence filed by both claimants' counsel and the Board, which indicates that there is still much corruption within the various police forces, whether they be federal or under the jurisdiction of the various Mexican states. In spite of the significant progress made under the government of President Fox to eliminate systemic corruption, the behaviour of several police forces is still a concern, as attested by the following excerpt from the US State Department's latest report on human rights in Mexico:\nImpunity remained a problem among the security forces, although the Government continued to sanction public officials, police officers, and members of the military. Widespread police corruption and alleged police involvement in narcotics-related crime continued, and police abuse and inefficiency hampered investigations....\nThe Government continued to take important steps to improve the human rights situation; however its efforts continued to meet with limited success in many areas.3\nIt is also too early to know the concrete results of an initiative announced in January 2003 by President Fox's administration to eliminate corruption in the war against drugs, as reported in the documentary evidence:\nPresident Vicente Fox's administration has stepped up its campaign to show that Mexico is finally ready, willing and able to root out the corruption that undermines the country's war against drug traffickers. Over the past few months, the administration has exposed with unusual openness a collection of corrupt police agents and soldiers who made it easier to smuggle cocaine and marijuana into the United States. And last week, the attorney general's office began touting the imminent creation of an agency charged with ushering in a cleaner era of narcotics operations.4\nBefore concluding, the panel would like to state that the identity documents submitted by the claimants are acceptable and the panel has no doubt as to their identity.\nCONCLUSION\nThe evidence concerning the most important points of these claims for refugee protection has been held sufficient to establish that, if the claimants returned to Mexico, they would have a reasonable chance at this time of being subject to a risk to their lives or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nFor these reasons, the panel determines that the claimants, XXXXXXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXXXX, are persons in need of protection and their claims for protection are accepted.\nCharles DeBlois\nCharles DeBlois\nDecember 10, 2003\nDate\n1 96.

In addition, the claimant also claims to be a person in need of protection.\nSUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS\nBased on the claimant's Personal Information Form (PIF), the oral testimony and evidence submitted, the claimant lived with his family in XXXXXXX, XXXXXX, Punjab. He worked on the family dairy farm.\nThe claimant alleges the following;\nHe served his Sikh temple as XXXXXX and later as XXXXX. At the local level, he was XXXXXXX of the Akali Dal Mann (ADM) political party, \"a party fighting for self-determination of the Sikh people\" (as per the claimant's PIF); therein, he gradually became the party organiser for the village.\nThe claimant was arrested on three separate occasions; on the second and third, he was tortured and subsequently released on the payment of bribes.\nHe was first arrested in 1992 for an hour, allegedly, because he was a baptised Sikh, thus, visible during a round-up. This arrest allegedly was due to his cousin who was sought by the authorities. Secondly, in 1994, he was arrested and detained for three nights, as he was said by the police authorities to have been involved in a plot to kill a Congress leader, XXXXXXXXX. Thirdly, he was arrested in 2003, detained for three days, and tortured at an undisclosed location. While tortured, he was in the presence of a mocking, XXXXXXXXXXX, whom he attempted to depose in elections and also whom he confronted to prevent a sale of village-council property at a price that was less than market value. The presence of the politician, the claimant felt, was to humiliate him.\nAlthough other situations of harassment and beatings were mentioned in the PIF, the claimant concentrated on his alleged arrests and detentions. The claimant stated, although warned by the police, he continued his activities except after the last arrest and release. The claimant alleges that he is wanted by the police for working with subversive elements and subsequently his father was beaten and his home was ransacked. The claimant's wife and children were harassed after he left the country and they have since resettled.\nFurther to speaking to a friend who suggested that he leave the country, the claimant went to Delhi with the intention of fleeing from India. A smuggler was contacted to organise his departure from India; he then travelled from India to Canada, on a false identity (passport), accompanied by a woman smuggler who, after posing as his wife and assisting him to enter Canada, disappeared.\nANALYSIS\nThe tribunal accepts the original of the passport, dated XXXXX, 1995, which was presented for the tribunal's perusal and also the filed copies of the identity documents, with reservations, because these documents were obtained after the claimant arrived in Canada and due to the fact that documentary evidence1 indicates that it is easy to obtain false documents, if one is willing to pay the price.\nAfter evaluating the claimant's testimony, and analysing the documentary evidence, the panel finds that the claimant's story is not credible. In addition, his testimony is not consistent with the documentary evidence.\nThe documentary evidence as a whole clearly shows that the conditions that existed in Punjab between 1984 and 1993 have greatly improved, that the police can no longer act with impunity although a climate of terrorism still persists in the country.\nThe documentary evidence indicates the following:2\n5.6.25 ?...? Officials of the Committee for Co-ordination for Disappearances in Punjab (CDP) considered that Punjab was now peaceful and that there were no problems with militant groups and no political problems either. The News Bureau Chief for the Daily Ajit remark that police actions were rare.\n5.6.49 Shortly after the 1992 elections, newspapers and magazines began to report that the situation in Punjab was improving. ?...?\n5.6.50 The South East Asia Straits Times reported that Punjab had returned to the path of peace and prosperity once more. Police roadblocks and the constant military presence had gone.\n5.6.54 The DIRB also interviewed representatives of three human rights groups that work in Punjab, and one human rights lawyer from Punjab. All were agreed that the human rights situation in Punjab had improved since the violence between 1984 and 1995.\n5.6.57 Doctor Cynthia Keppley Mahmood of the University of Maine agrees that conditions in Punjab have greatly improved since the worse days of the early 1990s, and it is no longer accurate to say that any Sikh is at risk of persecution simply because of his or her religion ?...?.\n5.6.59 Sikhs do not constitute a persecuted group at the present time, and rank-and-file members of groups that were at one time targeted, the AISSF, are in general terms now safe.\nIn addition, Akali Dal Mann (ADM) Amritsar is a recognized political party, whose leader S.S. Mann is an elected member of the government of the state of Punjab. Nowhere does it state in the above-mentioned documentary evidence, in which Mr. Mann expresses his opinions, that rank-and-file members of the party are persecuted by the police. If that were the case, Mr. Mann and the elected party members would have publicly protested and denounced such behaviour.\nThe document also indicates that no report states that rank-and-file members of the party are harassed. 3\nThe document states the following:\n\"However, since April 1998 Simranjit Singh Mann has addressed reporters publicly (The Hindu, 27 Apr. 1998a; The Indian Express 8 Sept. 1988; The Tribune 2 Aug. 1998; ibid. 26 September 1998) held a 21 October 1998 public forum with the families of slain militants in Amritsar (Burning Punjab News 21 Oct. 1998 a) and has also stated that his party will contest the up-coming Adampur Assembly by-election (The Tribune 26 Sept. 1998b; ibid. 4 Oct. 1998; (Burning Punjab News 21 Oct. 1998 b). There have been no follow-up reports indicated that Simranjit Singh Mann or his members and supporters have suffered any consequences as a result of these actions of statements.\"4\nOrganisations that the police consider to be terrorists groups, are listed on page 15, paragraph 2 of the document.5 The groups are the following: the Babar Khalsa; the Khalistan Liberation Force; and the Khalistan Commando Force.\nConsidering the foregoing, it is unlikely that the claimant was arrested because he was a member of the ADM political party, which the police do not consider to have terrorist links.\nThe above-mentioned documentary evidence indicates that the government has implemented mechanisms in the Punjab to counter police abuse:\n5.6.52 The panel agreed that the central government had been attempting to rein in the Punjab police, who during the insurgency were responsible for large numbers of extra-judicial executions and disappearances. Investigations into allegations of human rights abuses have sent a strong signal that the climate of impunity for the Punjab police is ending, even though that climate has been deeply engrained over many years and will take a long time to change. Reference is also made to the extensive human rights training for the police in India, which is seen as an example of the general trend in India towards recognizing and addressing systemic problems with the police.\n5.6.53 The Supreme Court was seen as clearly attempting to address the failure of the judiciary up until the mid-1990s to deal with human rights violations. Judicial protection in Punjab had improved and many people were using the judicial system. People who are not high-profile militant suspects are not at risk in Punjab. They have much less to fear from the police and now have better access to judicial recourse if they are treated improperly.\nThe claimant himself indicated that he was not a well-known personality in his political party. In addition, the documentary evidence6 shows that lawyers and human rights organisations are active in Punjab and that it is possible to obtain justice for such abuses.\nThe document indicates that a number of avenues are open to individuals seeking justice. 7 The document also indicates that SHRCs workload has increased from 90 cases three years ago to more than 2,100 cases today. An official of the organisation said that 60% of cases are settled within four to six months. It is therefore inaccurate to presume that consulting a lawyer or an entity to safeguard one's rights may have subjected the claimant to police reprisals.\nLastly, the report8 by the Director of the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative explains the steps to take to file a complaint and the success rate. The claimant cannot therefore plead that he would today be unable to obtain the protection of authorities if he needed it.\nUnder the circumstances, the panel finds that the claimant had the obligation of seeking protection in his own country before seeking refugee protection in another country although he allegedly stated that his fingerprints and picture were taken by police authorities when he was arrested on the second occasion.\nThe panel also considered the documents filed as evidence.9 The lack of credibility in the claimant's story leads the panel to grant no probative value to this document, which it believes to be a document of convenience.\nAs for the hospital report,10 in respect of injuries, swelling, and pain, signed by Dr. XXXXX XXXXXX, dated XXXXX 2003, the report makes no reference to the cause of the injuries.\nFor these reasons, the panel finds that the claimant, is neither a \"Convention refugee\" under Section 9611 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, nor \"a person in need of protection\" under section 97(1)12 of the Act.\nMichel M.J.

He alleges that he fears returning to Colombia because FARC guerrillas have targeted him for his \"perceived refusal to financially collaborate with them\". He did not claim to be a person in need of protection as a person in danger of being tortured or at risk of losing his life or being subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Colombia.\nThe claimant alleged that he had been a XXXXXXXX of a XXXXXXXXX in Bogota from XXXX 1988 until XXXXX 2000. He alleged that, following the murder of two warehouse administrators of the company branch in the city of XXXXXXXXXX, the owner of the company advised his administrators that it was becoming very dangerous for him to remain in Colombia and that he would be leaving the country for a while. He alleged that his boss had told the remaining administrators that the press and the armed forces had told him that the guerrillas had carried out the murders after the two administrators had refused to pay them the \"war tax\" requested. He further alleged that his boss was being extorted by FARC guerrillas. He alleged that in XXXXX 2000 the owner left for the United States and left him in charge of the warehouse in Bogota. He alleged that in late XXXX he began to receive anonymous calls threatening him with death if he did not pay a monthly quota. He alleged that he further received a letter from FARC demanding money. He alleged that in XXXXX 2000, he began to receive telephone calls and messages from FARC threatening to kill him if he did not give them the money. He alleged that on XXXXX, 2000, he was kidnapped by two armed men who first questioned him about his boss and his whereabouts, and then took him to an unknown location, where after removing the blindfold, he was faced with five men in guerrilla uniforms bearing FARC insignia. He alleged that he was again questioned about his boss and the warehouse, and was told that he would be killed like the administrators in XXXXXXXXXXX if he did not pay them 50 million pesos within a month. He alleged that he contacted the company owner who then advised him to leave the country because when he had experienced his problem with the guerrillas, he had approached the authorities for protection but was told that they were unable to help. He alleged that on XXXXXXXX, 2000, he left Colombia for the United States where he had a visa, but knew no one. He alleged that he then came to Canada and made a refugee claim on November 23, 2000, as he had friends in Canada who had advised that Canada was accepting refugees from Colombia.\nOn June 7, 2002, the Minister advised that certain investigations concerning the claimant were being undertaken, the result of which may cause the Minister to intervene.1 Accordingly, a postponement of the hearing scheduled for June 10, 2002 was sought and consequently granted. On July 12, 2002, the Minister, pursuant to subsection 170 (c) of the Immigration and Protection Act (IRPA), notified2 his intent to participate by filing evidence only with no attendance of counsel at the hearing. The Minister's disclosure consisted of a copy of a Certified True Copy of the claimant's passport and the following statement:\nThe copy of the passport indicates that the claimant had a five-year visa to the U.S.A. He made no effort to claim asylum in the U.S.A. even though there were no problems to enter the country as he has a valid visa. In fact, the claimant did enter the U.S.A., but chose not to claim there.\nThe claimant's identity as a National of Colombia is established by his testimony and the supporting documentation filed, namely a certified true copy of his Colombian passport3 provided by Immigration.\nThe determinative issues in this claim are 1) nationality, 2) credibility, 3) failure to claim in the U.S.A. or Panama and 4) state protection.\nGiven that the claimant had stated 1) in his Personal Information Form (PIF)4 that his father's citizenship was Palestinian (Israel); 2) in his Admissibility Form5 that his father held Jordanian citizenship; and 3) that his father held a Jordanian passport,6 the panel had to first determine whether the claimant had a right to Jordanian citizenship. Having considered 1) the affidavit7 providing general information given by an official of the Embassy of Jordan; 2) the specific information given by the Jordanian Consul8 in Ottawa, that XXXXXX is not a Jordanian citizen and that the temporary passport of his late father does not qualify the father nor the son for Jordanian nationality; and 3) the Jordanian Law or Jordanian nationality,9 the panel finds that the claimant does not have a right to Jordanian citizenship. Although the Jordanian Nationality Law states that children of a Jordanian man shall be Jordanian wherever they are born, in this case, the claimant's father was a Palestinian who had only been issued a temporary Jordanian passport that Jordan issued to Palestinians to facilitate travel after the occupation by Israel.\nThe panel also considered whether the claimant had a right to Panamanian citizenship. He testified that his father had residency in Panama, living there from 1983 until 1989, and then for six months prior to his death on XXXXX, 1991. He claimed that his father had neither Colombian nor Panamanian citizenship. Although the panel was not presented with any proof of this, nevertheless, based on the Panamanian citizenship law,10 the panel finds that the claimant does not have an automatic right to Panamanian citizenship since the only way he could have been considered \"Panamanian by birth\" according to the Panamanian citizenship law, would be as the offspring of parents who are Panamanian by naturalization, born outside the territory of the Republic, provided he establish his domicile in the Republic of Panama and state his desire to elect Panamanian citizenship not later than one year after reaching legal age.11 Consequently the claim is being assessed against Colombia only.\nThe most contentious issue in this claim is the authenticity of the FARC letters12 that the claimant alleges he received.\nAccording to a memorandum13 from the IRB's Specific Information Research Unit (SIRU), on December 18, 2001, their office received notification from the Canadian Embassy in Colombia that the FARC letters sent to them for verification were found to be false. An attached e-mail14 sent by the Canadian Embassy in Bogota to SIRU further states that the verification was carried out by the FISCALIA (Attorney General).\nA separate response15 to SIRU from GAULA, the National Police Kidnapping and Extortion Division in Bogota, dated January 28, 2002, points out the differences between the two letters in question, and the original document of FARC's Law 002. This response does not comment on the letters' authenticity.\nThe panel requested16 that SIRU seek the reasons as to why the FISCALIA had deemed the two FARC letters to be false. The FISCALIA's detailed analysis17 of the\ndocuments in question compared with different pamphlets in their database concluded that the FARC letters sent to them for verification do not correspond to letters sent by FARC because the form and the content are not similar. It further concluded that the documents could have been prepared by criminal groups using FARC's name in order to achieve their own objectives more effectively. The analyst of the subversion section of the FISCALIA recommended the assessment of the risk and vulnerability of this claimant to establish the degree of threat or vulnerability, and to determine the author(s) of the submitted FARC letters.\nGiven counsel's objections18 to the initial SIRU memorandum that the FISCALIA had found the FARC letters to be false, at the first sitting of the hearing on August 1, 2002, counsel was instructed by the panel to attempt to also pursue avenues for verification. At the July 7, 2003 resumption of the hearing, counsel presented an affidavit from Professor XXXXXXXXXXX dated July 4, 200319 pertaining to country conditions in Colombia as well as an assessment of the authenticity of the FARC letters. As this affidavit had not been disclosed in accordance with rule 29(4) of the IRPA, and considering the long period that counsel had to obtain such a document, she was afforded the opportunity to submit in writing together with her written submissions on the claim, why the panel should accept this late disclosure.\nHaving considered counsel's submissions outlining her many futile attempts to contact various bodies of the Colombian security forces prior to finally requesting Professor XXXXXXX assistance, as well as having considered the document's relevance, the panel accepts to enter the affidavit20 post-hearing.\nProfessor XXXXXXXX affidavit21 also points out numerous differences between the photocopy of Decree 002 that the claimant alleges he received from FARC, and the version of Decree 002 published in the FARC website. He concludes that they are formalistic in essence and in no way affect the substance of the documents. The panel finds that this affidavit does not make a clear statement regarding the authenticity of the FARC letters submitted by the claimant; it only justifies the numerous differences consisting of grammar and spelling errors by stating that it is expected from the peasants and rural poor who are mainly illiterate and who comprise the main ranks of FARC.\nHaving considered 1) the initial assessment from the FISCALIA deeming the FARC letters to be false; 2) the Bogota National Police's (GAULA) response pointing to errors, but not commenting on the authenticity; 3) the FISCALIA's subsequent detailed analysis indicating that the FARC letters are not similar to their FARC database and that they could be from common criminals, and 4) Professor XXXXXXXX assessment not\ndirectly dealing with the authenticity, the panel finds on the balance of probabilities that the FARC letters submitted by the claimant are not authentic. Nevertheless, the panel still has to consider whether the claimant received these from a group purporting to be FARC, or a group linked to FARC, who nonetheless purport to harm the claimant or whether the claimant had them fabricated for the purpose of bolstering his claim.\nIn reaching its decision, the panel took into consideration the totality of the evidence, the overall credibility of the claimant's evidence, as well as the documentary evidence which indicates that groups of common criminals often operate as a \"para-guerrilla\" group, carrying out abduction and handing the victim to the guerrillas22 and that FARC often purchased victims kidnapped by common criminals and then negotiated ransom payments with the family.23 It also accorded considerable weight to the FISCALIA's analysis, conclusion and objective recommendation. Accordingly, the panel finds that: 1) the FARC letters submitted by the claimant are not authentic, and that they were either sent by common criminals operating on their own and purporting to be FARC, or that they were sent by common criminals operating in collaboration with FARC. The panel also accepts that the claimant was kidnapped and threatened by persons purporting to be FARC. Therefore, the panel determines: 1) that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of criminals who the panel finds on the balance of probabilities were working in conjunction with FARC, based on his perceived political opinion for failing to comply with FARC demands which would be perceived as a political opinion contrary to FARC's political objectives, or 2) that he is a person at risk to life at the hands of criminal groups purporting to be FARC guerrillas.\nThe panel finds, on the basis of the evidence submitted, that the Colombian authorities would not be able to protect the claimant.\nThe documentary evidence clearly establishes that both kidnapping and extortion by guerrillas, common criminals, and \"para-guerrillas\" constitute a rampant problem for the Colombian authorities. In spite of efforts made to regain control of its territory and curb the number of kidnappings through the tightening of the penal legislation, the state is unable to take appropriate action to protect its citizens against the occurrence of such acts.24\nThe panel also considered the explanations provided by the claimant for his failure to make a refugee claim in either Panama or the United States (U.S.). He explained that he feared that because of the proximity of Panama to Colombia, FARC who also had a presence in Panama, could follow him, and thus also put his brother living in Panama at risk. Given that the documentary evidence25 indicates a presence of armed Colombian groups in Panama, the panel accepts as reasonable the claimant's explanation for his failure to claim in Panama. Considering the claimant's very brief stay of three days in the U.S., the panel accepts his explanation of his intent of coming to Canada from the time he left Colombia.\nHaving considered the extensive country documentation, the panel concludes that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of protection, and has established that the government of Colombia is unable to protect him and that there is not a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) for him.\nThe panel determines that XXXXXXXXXXXXX is either a Convention refugee or a person at risk to life in Colombia. Accordingly, the panel accepts his claim for refugee protection.\n\"E.S. Schlanger\"\nE.S.

The claimant is a member of the Hutu ethnic group. She indicated in her PIF that she had left Rwanda in 1994 for Zaire, which granted her asylum on XXXXXX, 1995. She then travelled to Kenya, where she continued her education.\nThe claimant wrote in her PIF that she returned to Rwanda in XXXX 1999. She alleged in her PIF that she had been compelled to leave Rwanda again in XXXX 2000 after being threatened. She alleged that she had travelled to Canada in XXXX 2000 by way of Uganda, Ethiopia and the United States.\nThe claimant admitted at the hearing that she had left Rwanda on XXXX or X, 1994 and had never returned to her country since that time. She also admitted that all of the allegations in her PIF concerning the alleged acts of persecution had been fabricated in order to support her claim for refugee protection in Canada.2\nThe claimant's PIF was amended to reflect the fact that she had lived in Zaire from XXXX 1994 to XXXX 1994, in Kenya from XXXX 1994 to XXXX 1998, in Swaziland from XXXX 1998 to XXXX 1998, and in Denmark from XXXX 1998 to XXXX 2000.\nThe claimant sought asylum in Denmark. She obtained a residence permit in that country on XXXX, 1998. The IRB made an information request concerning her status in Denmark on December 21, 2001. The Danish authorities replied to that request on February 18, 2002 as follows:\nReference is made to the kind telefax of 21 December 2001 from Mr. Geoff Zerr regarding the Rwandese citizen XXXXXXXXXXXXXX, date of birth XXXX 1970...\nMs. XXXXXX residence permit in Denmark is still valid and she has accordingly the right to return.3\nAnalysis\nArticle 1E: Exclusion clause\nThe claimant was informed at the beginning of the hearing that the panel would be examining the application of Article 1E of the Convention.\nArticle 1E of the 1951 Convention reads as follows:\nThis Convention shall not apply to a person who is recognized by the competent authorities of the country in which he has taken residence as having the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of the nationality of that country.4\nIt appears from the information provided by the Danish authorities that the claimant had not lost her right to reside in Denmark when she made her claim for refugee protection in Canada and that she had the right to return there.\nThe claimant stated that she had arrived in Denmark in XXXX 1998. She was granted a residence permit in XXXXX of that year. She had the right to renew that permit every three years. After a period of three years, she had the right to obtain permanent residence by making an application. However, she did not make an application for permanent residence in Denmark because she had left that country for Canada in XXXXX 2000. According to the claimant, she lost the right to return to Denmark when her residence card expired in XXXXX 2001.\nThe claimant's statements concerning her status in Denmark were contradicted by the Danish authorities, who confirmed on XXXXX, 2002, six months after her residence card expired, that her residence permit was still valid and that she therefore had the right to return to that country.5\nIn Khadijeh Shahpari and Mona Agha-Amiri,6 Rothstein J. ruled that when prima facie evidence is adduced with respect to the applicability of Article 1E, the burden of proof shifts to the claimant, who must establish that he has lost his status in the country contemplated in Article 1E.\nThe claimant did not submit any evidence, other than her oral testimony, to support her allegation that she had lost her status in Denmark. On the basis of the information provided by the Danish authorities, the panel has determined on a balance of probabilities that the claimant is legally in a position to return to Denmark.\nIn Shamlou,7 the Federal Court confirmed that in interpreting Article 1E the following criteria, as set out in Lorne Waldman's work entitled Immigration Law and Practice (1992), must be met before a person can be found to come within the 1E exclusion clause:\n(a) the right to return to the country of residence;\n(b) the right to work freely without restrictions;\n(c) the right to study; and\n(d) full access to social services in the country of residence.\nAs previously indicated, the claimant had the right to return to Denmark8 at the time that she made her claim for refugee protection. She was going to school in that country9 and had access to health care there.10 The claimant failed to discharge the burden that rested on her to prove that she no longer had status in Denmark. The panel has determined on the basis of the preceding that the claimant is excluded from the Convention under Article 1E because she has the right to reside in a third country as well as the rights and obligations granted to citizens of that country, other than the right to vote.\nWell-founded fear of persecution\nCredibility\nIn the alternative, even if the panel were to determine that the claimant was not excluded from the Convention under Article 1E, it has concluded that the claimant has failed to establish that she has a well-founded fear of persecution in her country of nationality.\nAs previously indicated, the claimant has admitted that the incidents of persecution she described in her PIF did not take place. She stated nonetheless that she is afraid to return to Rwanda because members of the Hutu ethnic group are persecuted there.\nThe documentary evidence entered on the record with respect to the Hutus' situation in Rwanda does not indicate that the members of that group are the victims of persecution.11 According to the claimant, the Rwandan government has put all of the Hutu refugees who have returned there in prison. The claimant's allegations to that effect are not supported by the documentary evidence. She indicated that one of her cousins, a lieutenant in the former Rwandan armed forces, had been killed with his family in 1996. She also stated that her uncle, a pastor, had been killed in 1996.\nThe panel found that the claimant was not credible. Moreover, she did not mention in her PIF that any members of her family had died in Rwanda in 1996. The claimant was not honest in her dealings with the Canadian authorities when she made a refugee claim on the basis of fabricated facts. She concealed the fact that she had the right to reside in Denmark and that she had lived in that country.\nFor these reasons, the panel does not accept the claimant's testimony with respect to the deaths of members of her family in Rwanda.\nThe panel has determined that the claimant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution in Rwanda. This determination is further supported by the lack of subjective fear that the claimant demonstrated in leaving Denmark, the country that had granted her asylum, to come to Canada. She stated at the hearing that her decision to leave Denmark had been based solely on her desire to join her boyfriend in Canada because she was pregnant and had been hospitalized in Denmark three times in connection with her pregnancy. Her decision to abandon Denmark, her country of asylum, had been based solely on personal reasons. In Shahpari, Rothstein J. stated that actions that claimants take which are intended to result in their not being able to return to a country of refuge may demonstrate their lack of subjective fear:\n?14? The Court will apply the law to the facts in each case. However, legislative anomalies or \"loopholes\" of the kind that arose in Wassiq will not be given broad application so as to assist Convention refugee claimants who engage in asylum shopping. Applicants should also remember that actions they themselves take which are intended to result in their not being able to return to a country which has already granted them Convention refugee status may well evidence an absence of the subjective fear of persecution in their original country from which they purport to be seeking refuge.12\nThe panel has determined that the claimant demonstrated a lack of subjective fear in leaving Denmark for Canada.\nFor all of these reasons, and after having considered the whole of the evidence, the panel has determined that the claimant has failed to establish that she has a well-founded fear of persecution if she were to return to Rwanda. The panel has also determined that the claimant is not a person in need of protection given that there are no substantial grounds to believe that she would be subject personally to a danger of torture if she were to return to Rwanda. The panel further concludes that the claimant is not a person in need of protection given that her return to Rwanda would not subject her personally to a risk to her life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nAccordingly, XXXXXXXXXXXXXX is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\n\"Karin Michnick\"\nKarin Michnick\nDATED at Toronto, this 2nd day of April 2003\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - NATIONALITY - HEARING DE NOVO - EXCLUSION - ARTICLE 1E - CREDIBILITY - SUBJECTIVE FEAR - FEMALE - NEGATIVE - RWANDA\n1 Exhibit R-1.\n2 The amendments to the claimant's PIF with respect to the dates of her departure from Rwanda and her subsequent travel were made by an initial panel during a hearing before the RPD on June 3, 2002.

He claims to have a well-founded fear of persecution in Guatemala by reason of his membership in a particular social group, namely, wealthy farmers. He also claims to be a person in need of protection as a person at risk of losing his life or being subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Guatemala.\nAllegations1\nThe claimant owned a profitable farm of XXX hectares. On XXXXX, 2001 he received a letter from an unknown party demanding 500,000 Quetzalas. The police to whom the claimant turned were unable to do anything. On XXXXX, 2001 he received a second letter asking why the money had not been paid and repeating the demand. The letter warned the claimant to say nothing of the demand. The claimant was afraid and moved from his farm in XXXXX, Chiquimula to Antigua - a town about 250 kms away.\nOn XXXXX, 2001, ten men went to the claimant's home and beat his wife so that she had to seek medical attention. The men threatened to kill the claimant if he did not pay. The same group went to the claimant's father asking for information on the\nclaimant's whereabouts. The claimant's father was unable to provide this information and he was shot to death. The claimant's wife left the home she had shared with the claimant and moved for safety to the home of their daughter in XXXXXXX. The man who took over the duties of guarding the family home was killed. On XXXXX, 2000 a similar paramilitary group killed the claimant's cousin.\nFearing for the violence in his country and aware of the lack of state protection available to citizens the claimant left Antigua on XXXX, 2001 and came to Canada where he sought refugee protection.\nDetermination\nThe panel finds that the claimant is not a Convention refugee as he does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in Guatemala. The panel also finds that the claimant is not a person in need of protection in that there is not a reasonable chance that he will be subjected personally to a risk to his life or to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Guatemala. No evidence was adduced to lead the panel to consider that there are substantial grounds to believe that he will be subjected personally to a danger of torture.\nAnalysis\nThe panel had before it no identity document with a photograph of the claimant that could help it in its determination of his identity. He said he did not have a passport and indeed appeared not to know that such a document existed. The panel had the opportunity to hear from a witness, XXXXXXXXXXXXX.2 He testified that he had been a neighbour of the claimant in Guatemala years ago. Having heard both from this witness and the claimant, and having looked at the documents provided by the claimant, for example, a birth certificate,3 the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is the person he alleges to be, and a citizen of Guatemala.\nThe panel can find no nexus between the fear the claimant allegedly has of unknown armed men who seek to extort funds from him and a Convention ground.4 The panel will therefore consider whether there is a reasonable chance that the claimant is at risk of his life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment should he return to Guatemala.\nThe claimant alleges fear of people who he does not know. He suggested that they were former guerrillas who turned to crime after Guatemala's civil war or former members of the army who had lost their jobs when the size of the army was reduced and turned to crime to earn a living. The claimant testified that his was the smallest of the five farms in the village in which he lived. He said that he had been involved in civic matters in the village and the panel accepts that he would be well known among the inhabitants of his farming village.\nAbout the notes allegedly left on his gate the panel has serious credibility concerns. The claimant is not a sophisticated urban individual. These notes were allegedly taped to his gate. They were allegedly not in an envelope. The panel does not presume to have forensic capabilities, but it does have a level of common sense and life experience. The notes were before the panel. They are neat, clean, and there is nothing on the paper to indicate that tape was on them then removed or that they were taped to an exterior gate before being found in the early hours of the morning of the next day by the claimant. The claimant's explanation about the notes being taped without the tape touching them makes no sense. The claimant explained their pristine state by saying that he had stored them in a Bible in an Urn\/desk in his home. He testified that persons who broke into his home on XXXXX, 2001 and beat his wife took money that was also stored in that urn. According to the claimant XXXXXX, his son-in-law removed the notes from the Bible and kept the notes.\nThe panel does not find credible or plausible that these notes would be in the state they are had they indeed been taped to the gate of the claimant's rural home. The claimant's Personal Information Form narrative5 states that the claimant reported the first letter to the police. At the hearing he said he did not go to the police because the note said he should not go to the authorities. This inconsistency was however not brought to the attention of the claimant at the hearing. The notes before the panel certainly show no signs of being handled, something that the first note surely would show had it indeed been handed to the police and handled by them. The panel finds the notes before it to have been created for the purposes of the hearing of this claim.\nWas the claimant in some other manner threatened with harm? That is not for the panel to speculate. The claimant testified to the murder of his father, his cousin and the person allegedly hired to look after his farm when he left for Antigua. The panel can find no connection between the alleged murder of the cousin in XXXXX 2000 and the claimant. At the hearing the claimant's testimony linking the murders of his father and the farm guard was clearly based on assumptions.\nThe panel lacks credible evidence that a group of persons, armed or unarmed, were seeking to harm the claimant at his home in XXXXX.\nThe panel finds that even should this have been the case in XXXXX 2001, the claimant has an Internal Flight Alternative in Antigua where he lived from XXXXX, 2001 to XXXX, 2001. Antigua is a town to the west of Guatemala City and a considerable distance from the claimant's home village in the east of the country.6 He testified he lived there with a friend, XXXXXXXX. He said he was not in hiding. He was selling kindling. He said he also looked for a house, his wife having asked him to do that so that she could move there and be with him. The claimant said he did not find a house and that was because he did not have the time.\nGiven his testimony of his time in that town, the panel advised claimant and counsel that the issue of an Internal Flight Alternative for the claimant in Antigua needed to be canvassed. The claimant needed to establish that he faced a reasonable chance of a risk to his life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Antigua in order for his claim to succeed. There was clearly no impediment to the claimant relocating there, having already done so with no harmful consequences.\nThe claimant was asked why he could not stay in that town. He said he would not be safe because they were after him. When asked how he knew that they were after him, he referred to the notes that had allegedly been left for him at his home in the village of XXXXXX. The panel does not find that to be a reasonable explanation as to why the claimant could not find safety in Antigua. We have no evidence that anyone sought the claimant in that town. On the contrary he said that he had no contact with the group he fears while living there.\nThe claimant also said that if he lived in Antigua he would have to sell his allegedly at present abandoned farm property in the village and that they would know and come after him. The panel does not find it implausible that if he sold his farm persons around would know that he had sold it. What the panel does not find credible is that they would know where the claimant was living.\nThe panel cannot even find that these allegedly armed persons are seeking now to find out where the claimant lives. The claimant's son in law, XXXXX, allegedly lives a XXXXXXX kilometres from the claimant's farm. He is married to the claimant's daughter. The panel heard nothing of him being approached by armed or other men seeking information on the claimant. XXXXX is the person who according to the claimant's testimony has been most associated with the farm and the claimant's house since the claimant left for Antigua. It is XXXX who allegedly hired a young man to guard the farm. This is the young man who was allegedly killed. Since that time, it was the claimant's testimony that it is XXXXX who is the only person authorized to go into the claimant's home. It is XXXXXX who provided the claimant with documents related to the claim. The panel heard nothing of the claimant's wife being approached for information on the claimant's whereabouts since her move to live with another of their daughters in XXXXXXXXX. The panel lacks credible evidence that the sale of the claimant's farm in the village would lead those who the claimant allegedly fears to determine that the claimant was living in Antigua.\nThe panel finds that there is not a reasonable chance that those who the claimant allegedly fears would look for him in Antigua. He does not face a reasonable chance of a risk to his life in Antigua, or to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment there. The panel therefore finds that the claimant has in Antigua an Internal Flight Alternative.\nThe panel is aware that the level of crime is high in Guatemala. A police study of crime over the nine months from August 1, 2000 through April 30, 2001 revealed homicides numbering 2,328 or the equivalent of one homicide for every 5,000 persons. The report found that nearly 70% of all crime took place in the capital and the primarily ladino southern and eastern parts of the country.7 In relation to bringing people to justice\nthe country's Prosecutor's Office has been hampered in its efforts to investigate crimes and prosecute offenders by inadequate training and equipment, excessive caseloads, and insufficient numbers of investigators.8 A 2000 document relates that it was thought at the time that there were about 1.5 million guns in Guatemala City alone, one for every inhabitant and that private security guards far outnumber the largely ineffective police force.9\nThe panel cannot find that there is no possibility that the claimant will be harmed by the general crime in his country. That is not however what we are called to find. Outside of his small village the panel cannot find that the claimant is a markedly wealthy man such as to make him an obvious target in a city. He testified to having no connection with narcotics trafficking or production in his country. He testified that during Guatemala's civil war he was a volunteer in his local Civil Defence Group, or Civil Defense Patrols (Patrullas de Autodefensa Civil, PAC). Response to Information Request GTM40160.E of October 2, 200210 states that among the many sources consulted by the Board's Research Directorate, \"No Information regarding the targeting of PAC\nmembers could be found.\" The panel cannot find that the claimant's profile is such in Antigua that there is a reasonable chance that he would be at risk of other than random harm.\nThe panel finds that there is not a reasonable chance that the claimant would be at risk of losing his life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Guatemala. Accordingly we find that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is not a person in need of refugee protection. The panel rejects his claim.\n\"Hope Sealy\"\nHope Sealy\nDATED at Toronto this 10th day of April 2003.\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION -PARTICULAR SOCIAL GROUP - NEXUS - CREDIBILITY - PERSON IN NEED OF PROTECTION - INTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE - MALE - GUATEMALA - NEGATIVE\n1 Exhibits C-1 and C-2, Personal Information Form completed by the claimant and amendments thereto - summary of.\n2 Exhibit C-6, Ontario Driver's Licence of XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.\n3 Exhibit M-1.\n4 Sanchez, Odilla Elviar Moali de v.

He claims to have a well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of Bulgarian police, racist organizations and citizens of Bulgaria by reason of his race - Rom and political opinion - member of \"Euroroma\". In addition, the claimant claims to be a person in need of protection because he would be subjected personally to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Bulgaria.\nAllegations:\nThe claimant alleges that he is ethnically Rom, born in the Roma mahallah, in the City of XXXXXX. He alleges that as a child and young adult, he was attacked, tormented and discouraged in the educational system by teachers and students in Bulgaria.\nThe claimant alleges that from 1976 to 1978, he worked as a metal-turner in a factory and later as a mechanic for two years but needed to find a better job to support his children. He alleges that prospective employers were not interested in hiring him once they realised he was Roma. In 1984, the only job he was able to find was as a general helper and driver at a meat-processing factory transporting bones and carcasses. In XXXX 1990, he alleges that at the factory, he was verbally abused and physically assaulted by fellow co-workers. He alleges that after being treated at the factory's medical office for his injuries relating to an assault, he reported the incident to his employer but he was told if he continued to cause problems, he would have to leave.\nIn the early 1999, the claimant alleges that he became a member of \"Euroroma\", a Roma organization that worked to improve conditions for Roma. He joined a small chapter of the organization in the village of XXXXX, with 25-30 members and worked actively to organize Roma events and improve living conditions within the mahallah. Although most of his activities were social and cultural in nature, authorities perceived him as one of the leaders of his chapter and were not pleased that Euroroma was bringing the Roma community together and fostering pride in Roma identify.\nIn XXXXX 1999, the claimant alleges that he was summoned to the police station and interrogated about his involvement with the organization. He alleges that he was detained for approximately two hours, threatened, and slapped on the face.\nIn early XXXX 2001, the claimant attended a meeting of Euroroma in XXXXX. After the meeting ended, seven organisers of an upcoming event stayed behind to discuss details. One hour later, as they were leaving, they noticed two police cars and were taken to the police station for questioning. He claims that he was detained and interrogated by the XXXXX police and then transferred to the XXXXXX police department for questioning. While in the XXXXX police station, he was beaten and threatened that he could be imprisoned. He alleges that the police warned him that he would be called in again for further questioning if he continued his involvement in the organization.\nThe claimant alleges that other Euroroma members had similar experiences and that even with an official complaint regarding their treatment, their concerns were not addressed. He alleges for his safety and that of his family, he decided not to take part in the organization for a short time.\nIn XXXX 2001, the claimant was returning home from a friend's when two men stopped him, verbally abused him and threatened to kill him. The claimant alleges that he was struck at the back of his neck with a metal belt and then physically assaulted while on his knees. He went to the emergency department to receive medical treatment but he alleges that he was too frightened to go to the police, given his past experience of beatings when being called in for questioning. He approached the Mayor's office, but was told that they do not deal with these types of matters and that he should go to the police. The Euroroma members were also of little assistance, but offered to speak to the authorities regarding the assault.\nThe claimant alleges that his mother was threatened that her family home might become a \"fire hazard\". It was at that time he realized that his life was in danger and that his peaceful involvement in Euroroma had brought him to the attention of the authorities and racist groups. He alleges that since his arrival in Canada, the police have asked his mother concerning his whereabouts. He alleges that if he returns to Bulgaria, he will continue to be persecuted by police, racist organizations and the general Bulgarian population.\nDetermination:\nThe panel finds that the claimant is a Rom and a Convention refugee, as he has a well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of Bulgarian police, skinheads, and the Bulgarian population for the Convention refugee ground of race - Roma and a well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of Bulgarian police for the Convention refugee ground of political opinion - Euroroma.\nThe claimant has to establish that there is a serious possibility that he would be persecuted if he returned to his country of origin. The panel finds, based on the credible testimony of the claimant and country conditions documentation, that there is a serious possibility that the claimant would be persecuted by skinheads, agents of the state and Bulgarians if he returned to Bulgaria. The panel finds that, based on documentary evidence regarding the cumulative discrimination of Roma and the Bulgarian police force's unfavourable attitudes towards Euroroma, amounting to persecution in Bulgaria, and convincing evidence of Bulgaria's inability to protect victims of racial violence, that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection.\nAnalysis:\nWith regard to his identity, the claimant presented detailed evidence in the form of international passports,1 Bulgarian identification cards,2 birth certificate,3 Labour Book,4 the claimant's summons5 and family photos.6 The claimant also provided the panel with his Euroroma membership card.7\nWith regard the claimant's claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of Bulgarian police, skinheads and Bulgarians by reason of his race - Roma and his political opinion - Euroroma, the panel found the claimant's evidence provided in his Personal Information Form (PIF)8 consistent with his oral testimony. The panel found the claimant's testimony credible and trustworthy and supported by medical reports of his XXXX 20019 assault at the hands of racists\/skinheads, a copy of a police summons and documentary evidence.\nDocumentary evidence corroborates the reluctance within the Bulgarian legal system to respond to complaints of police maltreatment of Roma and evidence of frequent racially motivated violence against Roma.10 \"Despite concerns about violence of this kind, expressed by both domestic and international organisations for many years, and the numerous allegations made by victims, prosecution authorities and police have remained indifferent.\"11\nThe claimant testified that while he was primarily involved with the social and cultural activities of the Euroroma organization, in addition to the recruitment of new members, and that authorities perceived him as one of the leaders of his chapter of Euroroma. In XXXXX 1999, he was summoned to the police station where he was questioned about his involvement in Euroroma. At that time, he was threatened and physically abused. The panel was presented with the original summons relating to this incident.12 Later, in XXXX 2001, the claimant was leaving a meeting of Euroroma when he and six other members were taken to the police station. The claimant testified that he was beaten due to his involvement in Euroroma. He also testified that the authorities generally had a negative attitude towards Euroroma, as it was bringing the Roma\ncommunity together and fostering pride in the Roma identify and the development of Roma culture.\nThe claimant testified that the Euroroma organization is a legal organization and as such, the police could not detain members due to their membership in the organization. Instead, the police would make unsubstantiated allegations that members were involved in criminal activities as a basis for their detention. This was a pretence to detain them and although the claimant had never been legally charged with having committed a crime, he was detained, beaten and harassed by the police under false pretence. The claimant also indicated that he was aware of four or five other occasions when members of his chapter of Euroroma were detained and physically abused by the authorities. The panel accepted the claimant's testimony regarding his suffering and the documentary evidence which is unequivocal in its indictment of racist groups and the police for violence committed against the Roma community.\nThe claimant provided the panel with a detailed explanation of why he did not apply for Convention refugee status in Greece rather than travelling to Canada. The claimant explained that the smuggler who assisted him in obtaining his documentation informed him that he had the best chance of succeeding in a refugee claim in Canada. The claimant testified that he did not believe that Roma from Bulgaria had a significant chance of obtaining status in Greece and that if his claim failed in Greece he would have been returned. The explanations were accepted by the panel.\nWith regard to the issue of whether the claimant experienced discrimination versus persecution in Bulgaria the evidence before the panel, including the PIF narrative and viva voce evidence established a long history of discrimination in education and employment, harassment and physical and verbal abuse by agents of the Bulgarian government (the police) and ethnic Bulgarians. The claimant testified to an incident in XXXXX 2000 where he was arbitrarily detained, threatened and brutally beaten by police and a second incident in XXXXXX 1999, when the claimant was arbitrarily detained by the police and was physically assaulted by them. The claimant also testified that he was subjected to one racist attack at a workplace in 1984 where he was beaten by three of his co-workers and required medical attention, and a skinhead beating in XXXXX 2001, where he was pushed, threatened with death, and physically assaulted with a metal belt. When the panel examined the incidents cumulatively, it came to the conclusion that the claimant was subjected to persecution in Bulgaria.\nState Protection:\nThe claimant testified that he feared nationalist racist Bulgarians\/skinheads, Bulgarian citizens, and persecution from the Bulgarian police. The claimant testified to an incident in XXXXX 1999 when he was arbitrarily detained by the police and subjected to questioning and physical assault, and to a second incident in XXXXX 2001, where he was arbitrarily detained and brutally beaten by police. The claimant also testified that he was subjected to one skinhead beating in XXXXX 2001, but that he was \"scared to go to the police, given the threats and past experience\". The claimant went instead to Mayor's office hoping to launch a complaint, but only the secretary met with him and informed him that they do not deal with matters like this and that he should go to the police. The claimant explained that the police were part of the problem, however, the secretary was not interested in his concerns. The claimant went to speak with members of Euroroma, but they too were of little assistance. The claimant also testified that in 2001, a local police officer stopped his mother on the street and warned her that the family home might become a \"fire hazard\"13 and that she should not be surprised if her son disappeared one day. The claimant's mother was very shaken and felt the whole family was in danger.\nThe panel considered crime and corruption evidence in Bulgaria.\nCrime and corruption remained primary concerns of the Government during the year. Notwithstanding changes in the Criminal Procedure Code, which became effective on January 1, 2000, significant improvements have not taken place. Observers believe that further changes may be necessary and that improved co-ordination between the police and the judicial system is required to make the law enforcement system more effective and less corrupt.14\nThe panel also considered whether the claimant would be able to file a complaint against the police or a beating by a police officer.\nAlthough government officials have stated that under the country's criminal law code, any complaints about beatings by police are required to be heard by judges; at times this law was not respected in practice.15\nHuman rights monitors reported that they receive many complaints from persons who are too intimidated to lodge an official complaint with the authorities. Most military prosecutors' offices refused to provide data on police brutality complaints.16 Documentary evidence generally indicates that where the police are involved in a complaint regarding their conduct, investigations may not be thorough or expeditious and the punishment, if imposed, may be reduced.\nThe claimant must approach his or her state if protection is reasonably forthcoming.17 The claimant has the burden of rebutting the presumption of state protection. In order for the presumption to be rebutted and in order to establish the reasonableness of failing to approach the state, the claimant must provide \"clear and convincing evidence\" of the state's inability to protect.18 The panel also considered:\nA guarantee of protection for all citizens at all times is not to be expected. Nor is perfect protection. Where a state is in effective control of its territory, has military, police and civil authority in place and makes serious efforts to protect its citizens, the mere fact that it is not always successful will not justify a claim that the state is not providing protection.19\nThe panel finds that the state of Bulgaria has not made serious efforts to protect its citizens against racial persecution. The claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection, as documentary evidence supports a finding of inadequate state protection from racial persecution.\nWhen the panel asked regarding an Internal Flight Alternative for Bulgaria, the claimant indicated that the country was small and that there was no where that a person could hide from the police or racists\/skinheads. The panel also found that as the claimant would be required to register with the police in his new city, the claimant's personal dossier would be moved from its previous police station to the police station that has jurisdiction over his new residence. The panel accepted that the claimant's testimony that his personal dossier indicates that he is ethnic Roma and that he is a member of Euroroma. In light of police attitudes toward Roma and Euroroma in Bulgaria, the panel finds that there is no Internal Flight Alternative for him. On the evidence before the panel, the panel finds that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Bulgaria.\nConclusion:\nThe panel finds that the claimant has provided sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to establish that he has a well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of racist Bulgarians\/skinheads, and agents of the state, by reason of race -Rom and his political opinion - member of Euroroma. The panel finds that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of adequate state protection in Bulgaria.\nDecision:\nGiven that the definition is forward-looking, after considering all the evidence, the Refugee Protection Division determines that the claimant, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, is a Convention refugee, therefore, his claim is accepted.\n\"Joan Cunningham\"\nJoan Cunningham\nDATED at Toronto this 24th day of April, 2003.\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - RACE - POLITICAL OPINION - ETHNIC PERSECUTION - PERSECUTION - DISCRIMINATION - STATE PROTECTION - INTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE - MALE - POSITIVE - BULGARIA\n1 Exhibit M-1.\n2 Exhibit C-5, item 1.\n3 Exhibit C-2, item 1.\n4 Exhibit C-2, item 2.\n5 Exhibit C-2, item 3.\n6 Exhibit C-2, item 4.\n7 Exhibit C-5, item 5.\n8 Exhibit C-1.\n9 Exhibit C-3.\n10 Exhibit R-3, Response to Information Request BGR39490.E, June 25, 2002.\n11 Ibid.\n12 Exhibit C-2, item 3, p. 19.\n13 Exhibit C-1.\n14 Exhibit R-1, CRDD Information Package: Bulgaria, item 2.1, US DOS Report for 2001, March 4, 2002, p. 3.\n15 Exhibit R-1, item 2.1, US DOS Report for 2001, March 4, 2002, p. 3.\n16 Ibid., p. 3.\n17 Canada (Attorney General) v.

He stated that he had a fear of persecution in his country by reason of real or imputed political opinion. He is also claiming refugee protection because he believes he would be subject personally to a danger of torture, to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nSummary of alleged facts\nAccording to question 5 on his Personal Information Form (PIF), the claimant was born in Lubumbashi. He alleged that he was a member of the Gbandi ethnic group. He further alleged that he had not experienced any problems in relation to his ethnic group before leaving the country.\nFrom XXXXX 1993 to XXXXX 1999, the claimant attended the XXXXXX XXXX XXXXXX XXXXX XXXXXX in Kinshasa, where he obtained a degree.\nHe stated that after completing his studies, he helped his father sell XXXXX. He stated that his father had a XXXXXXXX in the municipality of Kalamu in Kinshasa.\nHe indicated that, as early as when he was studying at XXXX, his XXXXX professor, XXXXXXX, spoke to him about setting up a forum for political and social discussions where students could come to discuss problems affecting how the DRC is run.\nIn XXXXXX 2000, Mr. XXXX went to see the claimant at his home and repeated his request to join him in launching his discussion forum project. The claimant agreed to be a part of the project and that was how his organization, the XXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXX XXXXX, was created.\nThe group, which was initially composed of six people, met on the first and last Wednesday of each month at the home of its president, Mr. XXXXX. The claimant attended a total of five meetings. It was decided at one of the meetings that the organization would have its own newspaper. The claimant was a member of the newspaper's editorial staff and was responsible for its publication and distribution.\nOn January 15, 2001, President Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila was assassinated. His son, Joseph Kabila, was appointed to replace him. The first edition of the newspaper, which appeared on February 12, 2001, was almost exclusively devoted to the President's assassination and his son's induction. The newspaper was free of charge and had a print run of 2,000 copies. Denouncing Joseph Kabila's accession to power, the newspaper criticized him because he was a complete unknown in the country, because he had never been seen in Katanga, because his origins were unknown, because the Congo was not a monarchy and because it was inconceivable for such a large country to be led by a young man of 29.\nOn the evening of XXXXXX, 2001, the claimant was informed by one of his colleagues at the XXXXXX that Professor XXXX had been arrested in the middle of a class by the National Intelligence Agency (ANR).\nThe claimant immediately sought refuge at the home of his cousin, XXXXXXXX, a XXXXXX in the Congolese Armed Forces, after notifying his father. Shortly after his escape to his cousin's house, ANR officers went to his father's home to arrest him.\nThat same evening, shortly after his arrival at his cousin's home, the claimant crossed to Brazzaville, which he left three days later on XXXXXXX, 2001.\nThose, essentially, are the facts that were brought to the panel's attention by the claimant, the only person to testify during the hearing.\nAnalysis\nHaving heard the testimony and analysed all of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant is a citizen of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) as he alleges. His identity was established by a copy of a birth certificate that was issued in Lubumbashi on XXXXXX, 1971.\nHowever, the panel cannot allow the claim for refugee protection for the following reasons.\nIn the instant case, there is cause to wonder whether the claimant established that he was in the DRC, whether he lived there during the alleged period and, consequently, whether he was subject to the alleged incidents. The panel has no hesitation in giving a negative response to that question.\nClearly, in any refugee claim, not only is the onus on the refugee protection claimant to establish that he is a citizen of the country of which he claims to be a national, but it is also and essentially incumbent on him to establish through valid and acceptable evidence that he was living in the country during the period in which he claims to have been involved in activities for which he was arrested, detained, mistreated or wanted.\nIn the instant case, the claimant failed to present any evidence that he attended school during the period covering his studies at XXXXX although he was allegedly in school there from XXXXX 1993 to XXXXX 1999. He did not present a work certificate although he allegedly took care of his father's business after finishing school. He did not present any evidence that he was a member of the XXXX or that he wrote for the XXXXXXX newspaper, of which he claims to have been the XXXXX of publication. He claimed that he was unable to obtain such evidence because he had no one in Kinshasa and could not count on anyone in the capital to take care of this.\nThe panel dismisses this explanation since it cannot believe that the claimant, who allegedly spent close to 24 years in Kinshasa, could not find anyone to help him obtain the documents he needs to support his claim.\nSimilarly, it is strange that the claimant would have destroyed or given to his cousin in France or to the person accompanying him the three documents with which he allegedly travelled from the DRC, passing through the People's Republic of the Congo, France and the United States. According to question 28 on his PIF, while he was travelling, he had in his possession a pass for the DRC, a DRC passport and a French passport. The disappearance or destruction of these documents seems highly suspect, especially since the claimant failed to produce any evidence to establish that he was in the DRC during the period of the alleged persecution or that he experienced the events of which he claims to have been a victim.\nIn the absence of any direct or indirect evidence that would demonstrate in a valid and satisfactory manner that he was in the DRC and was involved with the OPC during the period from 1997 to 2001, and in the absence of any evidence regarding his studies at ISTI or his employment, the panel must conclude that the claimant was not in the country during the above-mentioned period, that he did not experience the alleged incidents and that the claim for refugee protection must be rejected.\nDanger of torture and risk to life\nHaving failed to discharge the burden of establishing that he was in the country during the period of the alleged persecution, the claimant cannot benefit from the provisions of paragraphs 97(1)(a) and (b) of the Act because he is not a person in need of protection.\nConclusion\nFor all of these reasons, the panel determines that XXXXXXX is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection as defined in section 96 and paragraphs 97(1)(a) and (b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nMoreover, in light of the foregoing, because the claimant failed to take any valid steps in order to obtain documents from his country to support his claim or in order to establish that such documents were inaccessible, and because he destroyed or arranged for the disappearance of the documents with which he travelled, the panel has every reason to believe that the claimant is acting in bad faith and that he is concealing the truth about what he experienced, about the itinerary he followed before arriving in Canada and about the actual date on which he claims to have left the DRC. Consequently, under subsection 107(2) of the Act, the panel finds that the claim has no credible basis.\n\"Georges Gustave\"\nGeorges Gustave\nDATED at Toronto, this 14th day of August, 2003.\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - POLITICAL OPINION - DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE - DESTRUCTION OR ABANDONMENT OF DOCUMENTS - CREDIBILITY - CREDIBLE BASIS - MALE - NEGATIVE - DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO\n6\nTA1-16039\nTA1-16039\n",

The hearing was held on December 4, 2002, at Toronto, Ontario, under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act1 (IRPA).\nThe claimants base their claims on membership in a particular social group, namely, Tamils from the north of Sri Lanka.\nThe evidence consisted of the claimants' oral testimony, their Personal Information Forms2(PIFs), and documentary evidence filed by the claimants' counsel and the Refugee Protection Officer (RPO). Documentation3 was also entered on behalf of the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. An interpreter fluent in the Tamil and English languages provided translation. The hearing was conducted with the services of an RPO. Oral observations from the RPO and oral submissions from counsel were heard at the conclusion of the hearing.\nIn order to be determined to be either Convention refugees or persons in need of protection, the evidence must establish that the claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution for a Convention ground or must establish that their removal to their country of nationality would subject them personally either, (a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or (b) to a risk to their lives or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nDETERMINATION\nThe standard of proof to be applied in assessing whether good grounds exist is set out in Adjei.4 The panel is not satisfied that there is a \"reasonable chance\" or a \"serious possibility\" that the claimants would be persecuted should they return to Sri Lanka, based on their membership in a particular social group or any of the other grounds set out in the Convention refugee definition. The panel finds furthermore, applying the same standard of proof, that they are not persons in need of protection under section 97 (1)(a) or (b) of the Act.\nHISTORY OF THIS FILE\nThe claimants arrived on October 25, 1999 and they claimed refugee status at the Niagara Falls border. Their claims were heard on August 10, 2000. A negative CRDD decision5 was issued on September 21, 2000. Written reasons and notice of decisions were mailed to Mr. John Grice, counsel and to the claimants on September 27, 2000. Counsel filed an Application For Leave To Commence An Application For Judicial Review in October 2000. The Application for Leave was dismissed by Mr. Justice MacKay on February 5, 2001, due to the failure of the applicant (the claimants) to file an application record.\nThe claimants remained in Canada until June 21, 2001 when they proceeded to Buffalo, New York, where they remained for 96 days. They returned to Canada on September 30, 2001 where they made repeat refugee claims at the Niagara Falls border.\nA hearing date was set for October 3, 2002. At that time, according to the RPD records, the claimants were represented by Mr. Richard Aguirre, an associate of Mr. Lorne Waldman. Ms. Krassina Kastadinov, an associate of Mr. Waldman, appeared together with the claimants on October 3, 2002, requesting an adjournment for two reasons. Firstly, Mr. Aguirre had ceased his association with Mr.Waldman and the claimants wished to be represented by Mr. Waldman's firm. Secondly, the Notices to Appear before the Board were received by the claimants in late September 2002, resulting in insufficient time for preparation. The hearing was adjourned until December 4, 2002.\nISSUES\nThe claimants were advised that since this was a repeat claim, the principle of res judicata would apply. In applying this principle, the panel is guided by Vasquez,6 where Mr. Justice Rothstein endorsed the principles of res judicata in the context of a repeat claim. In his interim judgement, he examined paragraph 46.01(1)(c) and subsection 46.01(5) of the Immigration Act7 and concluded that the former is a statutory formulation of the principle of res judicata, barring future claims by a person who has been determined not to be a Convention refugee, and the latter is an exception to that principle.\nThe Court stated that the exception under subsection 2(3) of the Act8 \"seems to have been provided to cover the situation of changed country conditions\". In his interim decision, Mr. Justice Rothstein stated in paragraph 11:\nAgain, the issue of res judicata is relevant. The applicant cannot, after failing in a Convention refugee claim, make a new application, even under subsection 2(3), based upon evidence that was available for the first Convention refugee application. His time for raising his issue was when he made his first claim. He cannot hold this evidence in reserve as the basis for a second Convention refugee application.\nIn his supplementary reasons, he concluded that there were \"no special circumstances warranting the introduction of evidence that was previously available\". He also followed the classic res judicata analysis by citing the following extract from Fenerty v. The City of Halifax9 set out in Town of Grandview v. Doering:10\nThe doctrine of res judicata is founded on public policy so that there may be an end to litigation, and also prevent the hardship to the individual of being twice vexed for the same cause. The rule which I deduce from the authorities is that a judgement between the same parties is final and conclusive, not only as to the matters dealt with, but also as to the questions which the parties had an opportunity of raising. It is clear that the plaintiff must go forward in the first suit with his evidence; he will not be permitted in the event of failure to proceed with a second suit on the ground that he has additional evidence. In order to be at liberty to proceed with a second suit he must be prepared to say: \"I will show you that this is a fact which entirely changes the aspect of the case, and I will show you further that it was not, and could not by reasonable diligence have been ascertained by me before.\"\nIn view of all of the above, this panel concludes that in a repeat claim such as the one before the panel, the principle of res judicata will apply, unless the claimants can demonstrate that they have new information with respect to \"changed country conditions\", or that they now have evidence that \"could not have been ascertained by reasonable diligence\".\nIDENTITY AS NATIONALS OF SRI LANKA\nThe claimants presented identity documents in the form of birth certificates and national identity cards issued by the government of Sri Lanka. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities that the claimants are nationals of Sri Lanka.\nEVIDENCE SINCE PREVIOUS HEARING\nThe principal claimant's PIF narrative reads in part as follows:\n5. My daughter, XXXXXXX, and my spouse and I are extremely concerned for her safety both in Colombo and in the Jaffna. In Colombo, due to our absence from that city for the last two years, there would be no recent record of her stay in Colombo. When we were in Colombo, my spouse, my daughter and I had to register with the Colombo police every year. But now, there is a two year gap and the Colombo police will be suspicious as to the whereabouts and activities of my daughter for the last two years.\n6. Given her young age, her ethnic background, her sex, and her birth place, my daughter XXXXXX will be suspected by the Sri Lankan authorities as a Tamil Tiger suicide bomber trying to infiltrate the city. She does not have any other identification, other than her birth certificate, which shows that she was born in Sri Lanka. She cannot carry out a conversation in Sinhalese and she will not be able to communicate with the Sri Lankan security forces.\n7. Also, given the recent wave of suicide attacks in Colombo in recent times, most of which were carried our by female Tamil Tiger insurgents, and given that invariably all Tamil Tigers are from Jaffna, my daughter is at an extremely high risk of detention and also of torture.\n8. My daughter is also at risk in the North of the country since she will face forced recruitment by the LTTE in all LTTE controlled areas. She will also be at risk in government controlled areas in the North for the same reasons that she will be in Colombo. My daughter opposes the LTTE movement and she will face severe consequences, including death, once she opposes to join.\n9. My wife and I are also extremely concerned for the safety of our whole family since we made our travel to Canada using false Singapore passports. My family and I made use of our own original passports to exit Sri Lanka. However, from Switzerland, we made use of the Singapore passports al the way to Canada. All of this was done through an agent.\n10. We are now aware of the New Immigrants Law in Sri Lanka, which dictates a penalty and a mandatory jail sentence for any Sri Lankan who has left the country illegally. It is my understanding that his law is being used against Tamils in a persecutory manner, for having left Sri Lanka to request refugee status abroad. ...\n[typed with errors and or omissions]\nORAL EVIDENCE OF THE PRINCIPAL CLAIMANT\nThe claimant implied that he was advised to go to the United States of America (USA) for 90 days and he then would be eligible to return to Canada and make a repeat claim. He said that he did not claim asylum in the USA because he did not have sufficient money to retain a lawyer. In Canada he could receive legal aid and welfare. He could receive a work permit and his daughter could attend school.\nHe said that he could not return to Colombo, Sri Lanka because he has no friends or relatives there presently. He said that landlords do not rent to Tamils. He is concerned for his daughter because he fears that, because she is now 17 years of age, she will be recruited by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) or that she would be suspected by the army to be a \"suicide bomber\".\nThe claimant said that he could not return to Jaffna where his mother and brother reside because he would be extorted for money by the LTTE because he had lived in Canada. His other daughter is a British citizen who has been residing in the United Kingdom (UK) since 1998. She is unable to sponsor him because she is a student.\nEVIDENE OF THE FEMALE CLAIMANT\nThe female claimant said that all of her immediate family is outside Sri Lanka in Switzerland, Australia and Canada. She said that she is not on good terms with her parents and siblings who reside outside Canada.\nEVIDENCE OF XXXXXXXXXX the minor daughter\nXXXXXXXX said that she is afraid of the LTTE and the army. She has had no personal contact with either organization during her nine years in Colombo, from the age five-years-old to fourteen-years. She fears forced recruitment by the LTTE.\nCOUNSEL'S SUBMISSIONS\nCounsel submits that the claimants cannot return to Colombo because they would be told to return to the North of Sri Lanka. The minor claimant could face forced recruitment by the LTTE. In addition counsel said that, although there is a cease-fire, one cannot conclude that there is a permanent change.\nANALYSIS\nThe central issue in these claims is can the claimants return to Sri Lanka, specifically Colombo?\nThe adult claimants are approximately 57 years and 49 years of age. They are not newly arrived young Tamils from the North. Their profile indicates that they are not at risk of being a target by the LTTE or the army. They were residents of Colombo from 1990 to 1999. The principal claimant was educated in Sri Lanka and the UK. He was self-employed in Colombo from 1990-1999 and he worked for a company for a period of six months in 1999. He has marketable skills and is fluent in both Tamil and English. Considering that he was previously employed by a XXXXX distributor in Colombo, it is reasonable to conclude that he is able to work in a Sinhalese speaking environment. He alleged that he has no friends in Colombo. While this scenario is possible, it is not probable considering that he lived and worked in Colombo for nine years.\nThe principal claimant is in possession of a photocopy of his (NIC) that indicates that he was a long time resident of Colombo. The female claimant is in possession of her NIC that indicates that she was a long time resident of Colombo. These claimants could obtain passports by submitting an application to the Sri Lanka Embassy. They were previously issued passports by the government of Sri Lanka.\nThe minor claimant is in possession of school documents11 that state that she was educated in Colombo. She is in possession of a birth certificate. She too can apply for a Sri Lankan passport. She attended private schools in Colombo, whose curriculum included subjects in Tamil, English and Sinhala and it is reasonable to expect that she could be readmitted to her senior school. She is now proficient in English, one of the two languages of commerce in Colombo. There is no reliable evidence before the panel that she would be subject to forced recruitment in Colombo by the LTTE. She would be an accompanied minor considering that she would return with her parents.\nThe minor claimant is 17 years of age. She fears forced recruitment by the LTTE and she fears the army.\nThe documentary evidence presented by counsel and the RPO refers to the cease-fire Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) agreement that was signed by Vellupillai, the LTTE leader and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe the Sri Lanka government on February 22, 2002.12 The panel reviewed the approximately 375 pages of documentary evidence13 presented by counsel and nowhere is there any reference to forced recruitment by the LTTE of young Tamils in Colombo in 2001 or afterwards. There is also no reference to detentions of young Tamils on suspicion of being suicide bombers by any Sri Lankan authority in Colombo during the year 2001 or afterwards. There is evidence of continued forced child recruitment by the LTTE in the North and East (Batticaola area) in 2002 despite assurances to the contrary by the LTTE.14\nThe documentary evidence refers to the detention of a failed refugee claimant who was arrested after deportation to Sri Lanka. Thulasi Gnanakrishnan and her two children were arrested at the Colombo airport on February 28, 2000. A report15 in the Sunday Leader, a Sri Lankan newspaper, stated that Mrs. Gnanakrishnan was interrogated on two occasions totalling three and one-half hours. They were released with the assistance of relatives who lived in suburban Colombo. The same documentary evidence16 stated that failed refugee claimants who are detained for identification purposes must receive clearance from the National Intelligence Bureau (NIB), the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), the Crime Detection Bureau (CDB) and the Terrorist Investigation Department. The majority were released within 48 hours. The United States Department of State Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 2000 (DOS Report) does not note any mistreatment and detention of returned failed refugee claimants. A paper,17 presented by the Refugee Council of the United Kingdom, in reference to this incident, stated that the Canadian High Commission in Colombo told Mrs. Gnanakrishnan's lawyers that she was detained overnight at the police post at the airport to allow time for the police to \"confirm their identity\" and that \"she was free to go about her business in Sri Lanka\". There are no reports of further detentions of failed refugee claimants from Canada in the documentary evidence before the panel.\nThe claimants, according to the principal claimant's evidence, left Sri Lanka on their own valid passports issued by the government of Sri Lanka. In other words they left Sri Lanka legally.\nWhen all of the above is taken into consideration, the panel finds that the documentary evidence does not support a well-founded fear of persecution should these claimants return to Colombo.\nWhen all of the above is taken into consideration, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities that there is not more than a mere possibility that the claimants would be persecuted should they return to Sri Lanka, specifically Colombo.\nCONSOLIDATED GROUNDS\nSince the panel did not find the claimants' claims to a well-founded fear of persecution to be supported by the documentary evidence, they must also fail on the grounds of a risk to life and danger to torture.\nConclusion\nHaving considered the totality of the evidence, the relevant statutory provisions and jurisprudence, the Refugee Protection Division rejects their claims for protection. Therefore XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX are determined not to be Convention refugees, nor are they persons in need of protection.\n\"Martin Wakim\"\nMartin Wakim\nDATED at Toronto this 6th day of March 2003.\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - REPEAT CLAIMS - RES JUDICATA - PARTICULAR SOCIAL GROUP - PERSECUTION - MALE - FEMALE - NEGATIVE - SRI LANKA\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27.\n2 Exhibits C-1, C-2 and C-3.\n3 Exhibit M-1.\n4 Adjei v.

However, he had claimed refugee status on October 1, 2001. He alleged that he fears persecution in his country by reason of his race, membership in a particular social group and imputed political opinion. He also claimed refugee protection because he believes he would be subject personally to a danger of torture, to a risk to his life and to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nSummary of alleged facts\nThe claimant, whose parents are Tutsi, was born in Bujumbura and lived his whole life in the XXXXX district, where Hutus made up 60% of the population, and Tutsis 40%.\nHe said that the crisis in October 1993 was sparked by the assassination of the Hutu president at the time. Hutus killed Tutsis out of revenge. He added that the government sent a brigade to restore order in the district where he lived. The claimant's parents, who still live in the same district, have not moved. He said that his family did not have the money to go away. He said that, when he was in school from 1993 to 1996, Hutu youths told him that he had to leave the district with his family because Tutsis were not Burundian and that they were going to cut him in two because he was too tall.\nOne day in April 1998, XXXXXX, the claimant's sister, was on her way home from school when she was attacked by young Hutus, who, after taking her behind a house, undressed her and told her that she would bear a Hutu child. Soldiers who were patrolling the area and heard the girl's screams intervened just in time, saving her from the aggressors.\nOn XXXXX, 1998, the claimant was at the XXXXX market with his aunt when Hutu assailants fired at vendors, buyers and merchants. Gunshots came from all sides. The third paragraph of the appendix to question 37 states that general panic broke out. The claimant was not harmed, but his aunt was killed.\nOn XXXXX, 2000, the claimant went to Gitega with his basketball team to play against a local team. At the time, Hutu rebels occasionally carried out attacks along the country's roads. As a precautionary measure, the military's strategy was to have vehicles travel over certain stretches of the roads in columns. The bus that the claimant and his team members had taken was in one such column. When they arrived in Mageyo-20 kilometres from Bujumbura-assailants fired shots at the car in front of the bus in which the claimant was travelling. The claimant and his teammates crawled off the bus. They sought shelter until the military arrived and retaliated. That was when the claimant decided to leave the country.\nIn essence, these were the facts brought to the attention of the panel by the claimant, who was the only witness to testify in this case.\nAnalysis\nHaving heard the testimony and analyzed all the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant is a citizen of the Republic of Burundi, as he alleged. His identity was established by means of his driver's licence, his degree in general humanities and a notarial act in lieu of a birth certificate-all original documents that the panel saw and examined.\nWith respect to the claimant's credibility, the panel accepts the facts as alleged. The oral testimony as a whole is consistent with the written statements. The panel did not note any implausibility, contradictions, or omissions that might call into question the facts of the case.\nHowever, even if the panel has reached this conclusion, it cannot accept the claim, given that the fear the claimant feels is that which the entire population of Burundi has been feeling for several months now.\nIn fact, contrary to what counsel Anthony Kako has argued, even if the claimant is a Tutsi, the decision in Salibian1 cannot be applied in this case because the current conflict in Burundi has clearly taken on greater proportions and is headed in a new direction as well, in that Hutu rebels now target not only Tutsis but the entire population, whether in residential areas or on the roads, as the claimant's testimony and recent reliable documentary evidence have shown.\nReferring to the situation of insecurity in his country and generalizing the situation in comparison with what the population is living through today, the claimant testified that [TRANSLATION] \"now, not only are Tutsi areas being attacked, but bombs are falling everywhere.\nThis reality, which the entire population has been faced with for almost a year, is confirmed in the documentary evidence. The Response to Information Request2 dated April 2, 2002 states the following:\nDuring Hutu insurgent attacks, both members of the Tutsi and Hutu ethnic groups are at risk.\nNot only is this trend continuing, it is spreading throughout the country, according to the information3 below:\n[TRANSLATION]\nThe representative of ITEKA ?Ligue burundaise des droits de l'homme? reported that FDD members are continuing their murderous attacks and incursions in all regions of the country, including the cities. However, contrary to earlier years, when the Tutsis were systematically targeted, today all Burundians are victims of incursions during which Hutu rebels kill and plunder civilians in general.\nThe panel cannot thus determine someone to be a person in need of protection if his or her alleged fear of persecution is that felt by the general population.\nThis is precisely the situation in Burundi today. According to recent documentary evidence and as the claimant himself admitted, Hutu rebels do not target Tutsis alone. It is in this context that the current government, made up of approximately the same number of Tutsis and Hutus, has taken action to protect the population as a whole-Tutsis as well as Hutus-against the crime and insecurity affecting the entire country. The claimant acknowledged that the authorities sent a brigade to protect the residents of his district during the race riots of 1993, just as the military quickly took action on December 20, 2000 to pursue the rebels.\nMoreover, with the exception of the earlier events of October 1993, during which Tutsis were killed in retaliation for the assassination of the Hutu president at the time-events that were not at the root of the claimant's departure, aside from the minor daily skirmishes that every young Tutsi living in a largely Hutu area faces-the claimant was not the object of incidents that could lead the panel to determine that he was personally targeted. Whether it was at the XXXXXX market or on the road between Bujumbura and Gitega, the claimant was accidentally caught in the crossfire of Hutu rebels, without being personally targeted or singled out as a Tutsi. As for the incident in the market, he said that the shots came from all sides and that general panic broke out. With respect to the attack of XXXXX, 2000, it is difficult to imagine the Hutu rebels targeting Tutsis only given that rebels do not draw a distinction between Tutsis and Hutus when they are firing at a large number of cars forming a single-file column with the purpose, according to the documentary evidence, of plundering civilians.\nRegarding the skirmishes in his neighbourhood, during which the claimant was told by young Hutus to leave, he might do well to move to a largely Tutsi neighbourhood, where he could lead a more peaceful life, even if it meant that his parents would have to rent a house there in the meantime. Waiting to have the means to buy another house in a safer neighbourhood, which the claimant attempted to put forward as an explanation for his parents' decision not to move away, should not be accepted as the critical factor.\nDanger of torture\nThis ground does not apply in the present case, given that neither the State nor its agents have anything, express or implied, to do with the alleged persecution.\nThe grounds of a risk to his life and a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment also do not apply, as there is ample evidence that the alleged fear of persecution is a random fear, in that it is felt today by the entire population, regardless of whether one is a Tutsi or a Hutu.\nConclusion\nFor all these reasons, the panel determines that XXXXXXXXXXXXXX is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection as defined in sections 96 and 97(1)(a) and (b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\"Georges Gustave\"\nGeorges Gustave\nDATED at Toronto, this 10th day of March 2003\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - RACE - NEXUS - GENERALIZED RISK - DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE - MALE - NEGATIVE - BURUNDI\n1 Salibian v.

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX). The claimant is a citizen of Sri Lanka and bases his claim to Convention refugee status on the grounds of race\/ethnicity because he is a Tamil from the north of Sri Lanka.\nThe evidence consisted of the oral testimony of the claimant, the Personal Information Form (PIF),1 and documents submitted by the counsel,2 by Canada Immigration and Citizenship (CIC),3 and by the Refugee Protection Officer (RPO).4 Submissions from counsel and observations from the RPO were also considered.\nThis was a repeat claim, the first having been heard on November 24, 1997 and rejected on January 5, 1998, because the panel found that there was insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence, and that there was an internal flight alternative (IFA) in Colombo. A second claim was made but was abandoned on August 28, 2000, when the claimant failed to appear for a hearing scheduled for August 9, 2000.\nThe panel is guided by Vasquez,5 regarding what evidence would be appropriate and acceptable for this hearing - that is, new evidence relating to changed country conditions, changes in the personal circumstances of the claimant, as well as evidence that could not have been available at the time of the first hearing. So the issue before the RPD is whether, based on the evidence adduced at the hearing, the claimant is a Convention refugee or person in need of protection, as defined in sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). In order for the claimant to be determined a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, the evidence must establish that he would face a serious possibility of persecution for a Convention ground or must establish that his removal to his country of nationality would subject him personally either (a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture, or (b) to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nThe issues which were relevant to this claim were identity, failure to claim elsewhere, agents of persecution, changes in country conditions, IFA, the consolidated\ngrounds and credibility concerns arising from the claimant's oral testimony. The determinative issues in these claims are failure to claim elsewhere and changes in country conditions.\nTESTIMONY AND ANALYSIS\nIdentity\nThe claimant provided no identity documents and, although the panel will give him the benefit of the doubt concerning his identity as a Tamil because of the previous claim, the panel has no way of ascertaining if indeed he is from the north of Sri Lanka. He claimed that copies of his birth certificate, marriage certificate and passport were given to the Board at the first hearing but that he does not have a National Identity Card (NIC). According to his statement at the interview in Fort Erie on October 14, 2001, the claimant left Sri Lanka (in 1996) using a passport that belonged to someone else. At the hearing he testified that he used a fraudulent passport with a Muslim name. In any event, he claimed that he has lost all his documents because of moving to shelters and to the United States of America (USA). Furthermore, he suffers from epilepsy.6 While that explanation for failing to submit identity documents is plausible, the panel finds that the claimant has had more than ample time to obtain copies of identity documents.\nAllegations\/Failure to claim elsewhere\nThe panel found that the PIF narrative contained no new evidence that could not have been available at the time of the first hearing on November 24, 1997. Accordingly, the focus of this hearing was on changes in country conditions and his failure to claim in the USA where he went in XXXXX 1999, following his claim being rejected in 1998, and in XXXXX 2001 when the second claim was abandoned in XXXXX 2000. The claimant remained in the USA for about eight months from XXXX 1999 to XXXX 2000 and then from XXXXX 2001 to XXXXX 2001.\nBased on the M-1 documents, the claimant was removed to the USA on XXXXX, 1999. When he returned in XXXXX 2000, he was detained and released in XXXXX 2000 with an effective departure order for XXXXX, 2000. He was removed in XXXXX 2001.\nThe claimant's explanation for failing to file a claim for protection in the USA was that he was looking for a country that respects human rights, and that he preferred Canada. However, the panel does not accept that explanation as reasonable given that the USA is a signatory to the 1967 Protocol to the Convention7 and certainly has a record not unlike Canada's for respecting human rights. It is the panel's belief that someone who truly fears for his life, that is, has a well-founded fear of persecution, would make a claim for asylum when in a country which could offer protection, particularly when that person's claim had been previously rejected elsewhere.\nThe previous claim had been rejected because the claimant's evidence was found not to be credible or trustworthy. He had no new relevant evidence, yet still pursued a refugee claim before this Board. These repeat claimants have been called \"revolving door\" and their abuse of the system has been commented on in the Federal Court by Madam Justice McGillis who stated that:\nThe revolving door approach to refugee claims casts a dark shadow over our immigration system, places an unnecessary burden on Canadian taxpayers, delays the hearing of meritorious refugee claims and constitutes a scandalous abuse of our border.8\nThe panel draws a negative inference concerning the claimant's subjective fear of persecution, given his failure on not one, but two opportunities to file a claim for protection in the USA.\nChanges in Country Conditions\nSince February 2002, there has been a ceasefire with ongoing peace negotiations. While it cannot be said that the current situation is stable, but is rather in a period of transition, the panel nevertheless finds that there has been a significant calm, with a stoppage in the civil war.\nGiven the claimant's age (47), the panel finds that he does not fall into the category of Tamils most at risk of being recruited by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), or viewed with suspicion by the Sri Lankan security forces as a member or supporter of the LTTE and therefore subject to arrest, detention and mistreatment. In any event the documentary evidence states that:\nBoth parties have agreed to abide by international law and refrain from committing hostile acts against the civilian population, including torture, intimidation, abduction, extortion and harassment. 9\nSince the first claim, the Sri Lankan government has passed the Immigrants and Emigrants (Amendment) Act, No. 42 of 199810 and enforcement began in 2000. Counsel argued as per Balasubramaniyam,11 that:\nPursuant to section 45 of the Immigrants and Emigrants Act it is an offence for a person to leave Sri Lanka in contravention of any provision of the Act. Section 35 of the Act states that \"No person ... shall if he is a citizen of Sri Lanka, leave Sri Lanka unless he has in his possession a Sri Lankan passport\".\nFurthermore, counsel submitted that, as per Raveendran,12 this Act is not, in practice, a law of general application and that, in reality, it seems that it is Tamils who have been deported and who have been targeted for arrest under the law. Therefore, the claimant need only demonstrate a \"serious possibility\" or \"reasonable chance\" that he would be\nunfairly targeted by this law on a Convention ground. However, no objective evidence was presented to indicate how the Act is being applied at the current time in Sri Lanka. Nor was there any documentary evidence to support the statement that it is Tamils who have been targeted for arrest under the law. As per Balasubramaniyam,13 \"in the absence of any evidence from the applicants, I am not in a position to comment on the severity of the penalty having regard to the nature of the offence.\"\nThe claimant testified that he left Sri Lanka using a fraudulent passport but that he no longer had the passport. He claimed that he had lost the passport but according to the PIF, the agent has the Sri Lankan passport that had an expiry date of XXXXX, 1999. In any event, even if he were still in possession of the said passport, it would be necessary for him to obtain a valid travel document for travel to Sri Lanka and the panel finds that it is highly unlikely that the claimant would use a false travel document in this instance. Therefore, it is the panel's belief that the Act would not have an application to the claimant given that he would be in possession of a valid Sri Lankan passport for the return travel to Sri Lanka. Furthermore, based on the documentary evidence,14\nIn cases where the returnee is alleged to have used false documents to leave the country, the Controller stated that he or she would not be prosecuted upon return, as the prosecutor cannot prove that the person had left the country illegally, unless he or she is actually caught with false documents....with regard to someone suspected of an illegal departure, the person would only be charged if found in possession of fraudulent documents or came forward and admitted leaving the country using such documents.\nUNHCR was not aware of any cases where returnees have been charged under the \"Immigrants and Emigrants (Amendment) Act of 1998\" for leaving the country illegally.(emphasis added) According to UNHCR, there have been no changes in the procedures for returnees after the attack on the airport.\nAccordingly, the panel finds that the claimant's fear of returning, because he claims that he would be arrested upon arrival in Colombo, is not reasonable.\nThe panel finds that currently it is not clear whether or not an IFA is available in Colombo as was the finding in the first claim. In any event, as a result of the ceasefire, the road to Jaffna has re-opened and many displaced persons have been returning to the peninsula. Therefore, the panel finds that the claimant need not stay in Colombo, but he could return to the north.\nDetermination\nThe panel finds that the claimant did not discharge the burden of proof for establishing that he would face a serious possibility of persecution for a Convention ground or that his removal to his country of nationality would subject him personally either (a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture, or (b) to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nAccordingly, the Refugee Protection Division determines that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (a.k.a. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX) is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\n\"Kamala-Jean Gopie\"\nKamala-Jean Gopie\nDATED at Toronto this 20th day of February, 2003\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - REPEAT CLAIMS - CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES IN HOME COUNTRY - ETHNIC PERSECUTION - MALE - NEGATIVE - SRI LANKA\n1 Exhibit C-1.\n2 Exhibits C-2, C-3.\n3 Exhibit M-1.\n4 Exhibits R-1, R-2.\n5 Vasquez, Santiago Benitez v.

The claimant bases his claim to Convention refugee status on a well-founded fear of persecution in Pakistan on his \"political opinion.\"1\nThe claimant's brief Personal Information Form (PIF) narrative states as follows:\nI, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, was born in Karachi, Pakistan, in 1966. I fear persecution in Pakistan because of my association with the political party of the Muttahida Quami Movement (MQM). The MQM is the party of the Mohajirs, who are persons, and their descendants, who migrated to Pakistan from India upon the partition of the subcontinent. I am a Mohajir.\nI joined the MQM in 1986. I attended rallies, meetings, and demonstrations on approximately two to three times per week. I also made frequent and substantial donations of money to the party. On occasion I also handed out MQM leaflets. I was involved particularly in the MQM's \"Khidmat-e Khalq\" committee, which is focused on providing charity assistance to the poor.\nI owned and operated two businesses during my life in Pakistan. The first was a XXXXXXXXX shop, which I operated from 1982 until 1998. The other business was XXXXXXXXXXX, which I purchased in 1997. It operated until XXXXX 1999.\nAs a result of my MQM affiliation, the government officials and their allies targeted me, the MQM (Haqiqi). The latter group regularly targets MQM supporters for mistreatment, and I was no exception. My home and my business were robbed by them, my home on two occasions and my business on three occasions.\nI was kidnapped and held by the MQM (Haqiqi) on two occasions, once in 1997 and again in 1999. The first occasion I was held for two days during which I was beaten. I was released after two days upon payment of a substantial sum of money (60,000 Pakistani Rupees).\nOn the second occasion I was held for five days and again beaten. I was released from this kidnapping through the intervention of XXXXX. XXXXX was a MQM (Haqiqi) member, but he and I had been schoolmates and so he decided to assist me. He managed to get me out from where I was being held and arranged transport to Islamabad. I remained in Islamabad until I left Pakistan, and my brother operated XXXXXXXXX until he closed it down in XXXXX 1999.\nWhile I was in Islamabad, the MQM (Haqiqi) came to my home looking for me. They told my wife that they had killed XXXXX, who had helped me escape. They also said that if they ever saw me again they would shoot me because of my support of the MQM.\nI fled to Canada and I am fearful for my life if I return to Pakistan.2\n[Verbatim from the original, with all errors and omissions in the text.]\nThe Board received notice from the Regional War Crimes and Public Security Unit of the Minister's intent to participate in the hearing \"as matters involving 1F(a) of the Convention had been raised in the claim.\"3 The Minister's counsel noted that the Minister would be relying on the following aspects of the claimant's evidence:\nMr. XXXXX has admitted to membership in the MQM, an organization that is involved in the continuing sectarian violence in Pakistan, and has committed acts of terrorism in support of its political agenda.4\nThe Minister's counsel was unable to attend the first sitting of the hearing on December 16, 2002, but was able to attend the second sitting of the hearing on January 3, 2003.\nThe claimant testified that he fears to return to Pakistan because he fears the MQM (Haqiqi) or Haqiqi Muhajir Quami Movement (MQM-H),5 a group that he described as being a \"creature of the police and military in Pakistan.\" A document submitted by the Refugee Protection Officer (RPO), Terrorist and Extremist Groups in Pakistan, lists MQM-H as a domestic terrorist group.6 The claimant also testified that he joined the Muttahida Quami Movement (MQM) in 1986. This same RPO document lists MQM as a domestic terrorist group.7 Documentary evidence before the panel describes MQM as being \"responsible for several incidents of urban terrorism even as the MQM (A) [the faction led by the founder Altaf Hussain] participates in Pakistan's electoral process.\"8 The documentary evidence also states that:\nNews reports suggested that most violence was between supporters of the MQM and the Jiye Sindh Movement, an organisation purportedly fighting the cause of native Sindhis. Another rival with which the MQM frequently indulged in violent clashes was the Punjabi-Pukhtoon Ittehad (PPI), an outfit comprising of armed extremists from the Pukhtoon and Punjabi communities. Random attacks by armed activists of the warring groups on unarmed civilians were the major cause for casualties.9\nThe claimant testified that he attended many MQM meetings and processions. He also stated that he \"used to help financially and monetarily\" and that he has continued his service while in Canada.\nThe claimant testified that he experienced incidents of robbery, abduction and detention, and assault at the hands of the MQM (Haqiqi). These incidents took place in 1994, 1997 and 1999. Following the last alleged incident the claimant went to Islamabad, applied for a Canadian Visitors Visa and travelled to Canada.10 The claimant arrived in Canada on April 17, 2000, but did not make his claim until December 8, 2000, approximately eight months after his arrival in Canada.11\nOn January 6, 2003, the panel received a fax from counsel that included copies of receipts of donations that the claimant made to the Khidmat-E-Khalq Committee U.S.A.\nand Canada, that were presented to the panel on the January 3, 2003, sitting.12 Counsel also presented a post-hearing document taken from the MQM website concerning the Khidmat-e-Khalq.13 The panel duly considered this document, along with all of the other evidence presented before reaching a decision in this claim.\nDETERMINATION\nAfter carefully considering the evidence before me, I find that the Minister has met the burden in establishing that the claimant is complicit in crimes against humanity by virtue of his knowing support and financing of the MQM and later the MQM (A) in Pakistan. The claimant is, therefore, excluded from the Convention under Article 1F(a). Further, I do not find that the claimant presented credible or trustworthy evidence that he ever suffered alleged robberies, kidnappings, and beatings at the hands of the MQM (Haqiqi).\nANALYSIS\nThe panel does not find the claimant's evidence regarding alleged robberies, kidnapping and beatings by the MQM (Haqiqi) to be credible or trustworthy. The claimant arrived in Canada on his own Pakistani passport with a valid Canadian Visitor Visa (CVV)14. The claimant did not first seek refugee status. Rather, the claimant sought to remain in Canada on a \"business visa.\" He testified that he had his CVV extended until XXXXX, 2000. He said he wanted to start a restaurant in Canada. The claimant testified he claimed refugee status in XXXXX 2000 because he did not want to stay in Canada illegally. The claimant's explanation for delaying making a claim to refugee status in Canada was that he did not want to be stamped as a \"refugee\" in Canada because he had that label in Pakistan, \"Mohajir.\" The panel does not find this explanation for his delay in claiming refugee protection in Canada to be satisfactory. It does not have the \"ring of truth.\" Given the abuse and trauma the claimant allegedly suffered in Pakistan, it is not reasonable for the panel to accept that was why the claimant would delay making his claim to refugee protection.15 Indeed, the claimant's first reaction was to remain in Canada on a \"business visa.\" This suggests the claimant was motivated to come to Canada for economic reasons and not to seek refugee protection.16 This points to the claimant's lack of subjective well-founded fear of persecution in Pakistan as well as his lack of credibility.17\nWhen the Refugee Protection Officer (RPO) asked the claimant if he was afraid to return to Pakistan, he answered, \"No,\" and, then, \"Yes.\" He claimed that he was first confused when he answered this question and that the time apart from his family has been painful. The panel does not accept the claimant's explanation for this contradictory evidence on such a simple and obvious question. If the claimant truly feared returning to Pakistan, he would have immediately said so. The claimant is not uneducated or na\u00efve. Again, this points to the claimant's overall lack of credibility.\nTaking into consideration the negative credibility findings noted above, the panel does not accept the claimant had any alleged experiences of robbery, kidnapping, beatings, etc., at the hands of any extremist or militant groups in Pakistan as he alleges.\nIt is uncontested that the claimant was a member of MQM and now is a member of MQM (A). He testified that he joined this movement in 1986. Indeed, he testified that he is still \"rendering services to the MQM (A) in Toronto.\" The claimant testified that he continues to support the MQM (A) by giving money to them in Canada. The claimant testified that he was a MQM (A) fundraiser in Pakistan and that today he does the same work for the organization. The claimant testified that the work of MQM (A) is done through the money that he and other people contribute to this organization.\nThe panel accepts that the claimant's identity as a citizen of Pakistan is established by the documents presented.18 The claimant also presented a letter from M. Anwar, Chief Organiser, MQM in the United Kingdom and Europe, that states, \"Mr. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX has been a worker of Muttahida Quami Movement (MQM) in Malir, Karachi. At present, he is an active member of MQM Toronto Unit in Canada.\"19\nThe question before the panel is whether \"there are serious reasons for considering that: (a) he [the claimant] has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect to such crimes.\"20 As noted previously, there is evidence before the panel that MQM (A) has been labelled a terrorist group in Pakistan.21 The documentary evidence on Pakistan indicates that the dividing line between socio-politico-religious groups and terrorist groups is often not clear. For instance, the United States Department of State, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices 2001, for Pakistan states as follows:\nThe Muttahida Quami Movement (MQM), an urban Sindh-based political party that in the past used violence to further its aims, claimed that the police specifically targeted its adherent for extrajudicial killings. Altaf Hussain established the MQM in 1984 to promote the rights of Mohajirs, the descendants of Urdu-speaking Muslims who migrated from India to Pakistan following partition in 1947. Elements of the group became involved in extortion and other forms of racketeering, and the party split into the MQM-Altaf - the original group headed by Altaf Hussain, a large breakaway group (MQM-Haqiqi), and a few smaller factions. The MQM-Altaf, in part because of its efficient organization and willingness to use violence, became the dominant political party in Karachi and Hyderabad; however, the party sent several moderate and nonviolent leaders to the suspended Parliament and the Sindh provincial assembly. Because of its past links to violent groups, the MQM-Altaf has antagonized followers, suffered violent breakaways, and continually been at odds with successive governments.22\nThe Office of International Criminal Justice's publication, Extremist Groups: An International Compilation of Terrorist Organizations, Violent Political Groups and Issue-Oriented Militant Movements, states that the MQM \"often use[s] violent tactics, especially against Sindhi nationalists (although they identify more with them than the Punjabis and Pakhtoons who reside in Sind); Pakistani authorities claim both the main and Haqiqi factions have been infiltrated and are being used by drug barons.\"23 This document describes the structure of the MQM as comprised of \"violent cadres [that] are cellular\" and that \"Pakistani intelligence estimates that 1,000 MQM 'terrorists' are active in Karachi.\"24 It also describes the type of activities of the MQM as, \"assassinations, bombings, kidnappings, violent demonstrations; typical urban terrorism.\"25 Among some\nof the significant activities listed for 1992 is that in June of that year the \"Government arrested at least 50 members (including three MQM members of parliament) and seized a large quantity of arms (rocket launchers, AK-47s) and ammunition. Police find 23 torture chambers allegedly run by MQM to deal with opponents.\"26\nThe British Home Office, Country Information and Policy Unit, October 2002, Pakistan Assessment report states that in 1995 the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) \"government unleashed an anti-MQM propaganda campaign, alleging further discoveries of MQM torture chambers, execution sites and arms caches.\"27 This report also states that in \"May 1997 violence returned to Karachi with political and revenge killings, mostly involving battles between MQM and the dissident Haqiqi faction.\"28 This report goes on to note that:\nIn the intra-Mohajir violence that continues in Karachi, victims are sometimes held then tortured by opposing groups (or as the MQM (Altaf) alleges by security forces). The bodies of these victims - often mutilated - are generally dumped in the street soon after the victims are abducted.29\nIt is important to note that the founder and leader of the MQM(A), Altaf Hussain, was sentenced in absentia to 27 years in prison in 1994 for dozens of charges in Pakistan, including murder.30 Altaf Hussain went to London, England, in 1991 for medical treatment before a government crackdown in May 1992 and has remained there in self-imposed exile.31 Counsel provided a copy of a letter from the British Immigration and Nationality Directorate that Altaf Hussain was \"granted leave to remain in the United Kingdom indefinitely under the special measures introduced for clearing the asylum backlog.\"32 A grant of indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom is not, of course, a determination that the person is a Convention refugee.\nThe documentary evidence before the panel clearly indicates that Altaf Hussain continues to direct the affairs of the MQM (A) from abroad and, indeed, that the MQM (A) has active units in the United Kingdom and other countries in Europe, and even in Canada.33 The MQM (A) is not only a domestic Pakistani organization but also an international organization with its international secretariat located in the United Kingdom at \"Elizabeth House, First Floor, 54-58 High Street, Edgware, Middlesex, HA8 7EJ.\"34\nThere is sufficient documentary evidence before the panel to establish that the MQM (A) is an extremist militant organization, which is even referred to as terrorist group by some, that has used violence and torture to advance its political objectives in Pakistan.\nThe Minister's counsel asked the claimant whether he was aware whether the MQM (A) was ever involved in any illegal activities and the claimant answered that the MQM (A) was not involved in illegal activities. The Minister's counsel asked the claimant whether the MQM (A) carried guns and the claimant said, \"No.\" The Minister's counsel also asked whether the MQM (A) ever kidnapped anyone, and the claimant answered, \"No.\" The Minister's counsel also asked if the MQM (A) was involved in terrorism and the claimant responded that there have been many accusations but that MQM (A) had not been involved in terrorism. The Minister's counsel also asked the claimant if the MQM (A) has torture cells and the claimant stated, \"No.\" Rather, the claimant testified it was the MQM (H) members who were involved in torture.\nIn his submissions, the Minister's counsel noted that the claimant had testified that he had worked for the MQM \"day and night\" since he joined in 1986, yet the claimant says that he is unaware of human rights violations perpetrated by the MQM (A). The Minister's counsel submits that the claimant was either \"willfully blind\" to the human rights violations that the MQM (A) was engaged in or that he was denying his knowledge of the nature of the MQM (A) as an extremist militant group. The Minister's counsel also submits that the claimant continues to finance MQM (A) activities from Canada and that the claimant had testified that if the allegations of the serious human rights violations by the MQM (A) were, in fact, true he would not be involved in this group. The Minister's counsel noted that there are a variety of reliable international sources that state that the MQM (A) has perpetrated grave and serious human right violations, which the claimant disingenuously denies having any knowledge of whatsoever. At the same time, the claimant testified, Minister's counsel argues, that he continues to finance the MQM (A) but that he would not do so if he were aware that it perpetrated serious human rights abuses. The Minister's counsel submits that the claimant's testimony is indicative of someone with a guilty mind. The panel finds the Minister's counsel submissions on point to be persuasive.\nThe claimant is a successful businessman.35 He is well educated and holds a Bachelor of XXXXX degree from XXXXXXXXX in Karachi and certificates from the XXXXXXXXXXXXX in Karachi and the XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX.36 It is evident that the claimant is not inexperienced or unsophisticated. He arrived in Canada with his own passport with a valid Canadian visitor visa. Given the claimant's alleged degree of involvement and support for the MQM and MQM (A) since 1986, over the last sixteen years, it simply is not reasonable for the panel to accept that the claimant would not have been aware of the serious human rights abuses and violations that have been attributed to the MQM (A) in Pakistan.\nIndeed, when the Minister's counsel asked the claimant whether he would continue to support and finance the MQM (A) if the allegations that it was involved in human rights violations were true, he said, that he would not continue to support MQM (A). In light of the panel's finding that the claimant was not credible when he testified that he was unaware of the allegations of human rights abuses against the MQM (A), the panel finds the claimant's evidence on this point not to be either trustworthy or credible. The panel finds the claimant was knowledgeable about the nature of the human rights violations that the MQM and the MQM (A) were engaged in but chose to continue to support it. Accordingly, the panel finds that the claimant was a knowing and willing supporter of the MQM's and, after it splintered into various factions, the MQM (A)'s acts of terrorism amounting to crimes against humanity.37\nThe Minister's counsel submits that the claimant's past work for the MQM and MQM (A) as a fundraiser and his continued financial support of the MQM (A), even within Canada, makes him complicit in crimes against humanity and, therefore, he should be excluded from Convention refugee status.\nMr. Justice Blais has noted that the Federal Court of Canada \"has consistently maintained the standard of proof for Article 1F of the Convention is less than proof on a balance of probabilities.\"38 In doing so, he notes that Madame Justice Reed, in Hajialikhani, states as follows:\nInstead of requiring a determination as to whether, on the balance of probabilities, there exist serious reasons for considering that a crime has been committed, the phrase \"serious reasons for considering\" has been interpreted as describing the burden of proof to be applied to a determination of whether the individual has committed or been complicit in one or more of the crimes. That burden of proof is lower than that required by a finding on the balance of probabilities.39\nIn this same judgement, Madame Justice Reed, ruled that a claimant's involvement in soliciting funds in Canada from Iranians for support of the Mujahdeed is a factor in establishing complicity, and states, the following:\nI agree with counsel for the Minister's argument that the Board did not analyze this evidence, and applied an incorrect test by asking whether the claimant was personally involved in the crimes alleged, in the sense of being physically present, rather than whether his involvement was such as to encourage and enable the commission of the alleged crimes by others. There is no doubt that financing crimes makes one complicit therein.40\nThere is no issue in this claim that the claimant supported and financed the\noperations of the MQM (A), both, since his arrival in Canada and while he was resident in Pakistan. There is evidence, cited above, that the MQM (A) is a terrorist organization that has committed crimes against humanity through the deliberate use of violence, torture and murder. In Pushpanathan, Mr. Justice Blais notes that an organization need not engage \"solely and exclusively in acts of terrorism\" in order to be an organization with a limited and brutal purpose.41 Mr. Justice Blais states that \"Mehmoud v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1998] F.C.J. No. 1019 (F.C.T.D.) and Shakarabi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1998] F.C.J. No. 444 (F.C.T.D.) illustrate that where there is no evidence that political objectives can be separated from militaristic activities, an organization could still be found to have a limited, brutal purpose.\"42 The MQM (A) in Pakistan fits clearly this description. The documentary evidence before the panel states that violence has always accompanied the MQM (A)'s political activities; for instance, engaging in urban terrorism while also participating in Pakistan's electoral process.43\nHence, the panel concludes that the claimant had \"personal and knowing participation\" in international crimes and crimes against humanity attributed to the MQM (A). As a member, contributor and fundraiser for the MQM and the MQM (A), the\nclaimant knowingly and willingly contributed to these organizations' acts of terrorism in Pakistan. Accordingly, the panel finds that there are serious reasons for considering that the claimant was complicit in crimes against humanity and is, therefore, excluded from consideration from Convention refugee status under Article 1F(a).\nSection 98 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) renders the exclusion clauses, sections E and F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention applicable to Section 97(1)(a) and 97(1)(b), hence, the claimant also cannot be a person in need of protection.\nFor the above noted reasons, the Refugee Protection Division determines XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX claim for refugee protection is rejected.\n\"James C.

By application dated July 31, 2003, he applied to have his claim re-opened.\nI have considered the entire contents of the application and his RPD file.\nFor the following reasons, I am not persuaded that there has been a failure to observe a principle of natural justice that would warrant reopening the claim.1\nEven if it is true that the claimant was unable to appear on April 30, 2003 due to a conflict in Ontario Provincial Court, there are a number of other unexplained defaults and other facts suggesting a lack of diligence in pursuing the claim. First of all, to date, the claimant has still failed to explain why he did not return the Claimant's Reply Form within the time required. It should be noted that it was this failure that put him in default of proceedings and the RPD in position to declare the claim abandoned.2 Again, this default remains completely and totally unexplained.\nSecondly, it is unclear when the claimant first discovered the conflict with the hearing in Ontario Provincial Court. Furthermore, it is evident from the record that the claimant and his RPD counsel did not seek to change the date and time of the RPD hearing until the day before the hearing. The application contains no explanation as to why this could not have been done much earlier than it was done.\nFinally, the claimant did not apply to reopen this claim until nearly two months after it was declared abandoned. In my view, this ought to have been done immediately and the claimant's failure to do so indicates a lack of diligence in pursing his claim.\nMoreover, in my view, it makes no sense to view applications of this nature in total individual isolation. The RPD devotes considerable effort and resources to ensuring that hearings proceed as scheduled. Indeed, it was for this reason that the claimant was sent a Claimant's Confirmation of Readiness with the request to return the Claimant's Reply Form. This is not done to protect the interests of the RPD itself, nor is it merely a matter of administrative convenience or efficiency. It is done to protect the interests of all of the rest of the claimants before the RPD. The failure of one claimant to respect RPD procedures necessarily means that the claim of another claimant does not get heard when it otherwise might have. In my view, this collective RPD claimant interest is very serious and one that is equally important to the individual interest of this claimant.\nFor all these reasons, I find that there has not been a denial of natural justice.\nFor all these reasons, the Refugee Protection Division rejects the application.\n\"Joel A.

He claims to be a Convention refugee or alternatively, a person in need of protection.\nThe applicability of Article 1E\nWhile the Minister of Citizenship & Immigration (MCI) did not attend the hearing, he participated in it through the filing of evidence and submissions. The Minister's position is that the claimant obtained permanent resident status in the United States in 1982, which status is either still valid or if not valid, can be renewed. Article 1E should, therefore, apply to this case.\nThe claimant admits that he obtained permanent status in the United States, where he arrived not as a refugee but as a machinist with a work permit. After three years, however, the claimant left the country and returned to Colombia. He stayed in Colombia for 13 years and then flew directly to Canada to claim refugee status. It is his contention that his Green Card will no longer be considered valid by the United States authorities by virtue of his long absence from the United States. He cannot obtain refuge in the United States and Article 1E should not apply to him.\nThe issue before me is set out in Mahdi.1 \"The real question,\" the Federal Court of Appeal wrote, \"that the Board had to decide in this case was whether the respondent was, when he applied for admission to Canada, a person who was still recognized by the competent authorities of the United States as a permanent resident of that country.\"\nIt is my finding, using the balance of probabilities standard advocated by Mahdi, that the claimant was, when he applied for admission to Canada, no longer recognized by the United States as a permanent resident of that country. I do so on the following grounds:\n(a) The claimant obtained his Green Card in the United States in 1983; he left the United States in 1985. He stayed in his native country for the next 13 years. This is, by any definition, a long absence.\n(b) The claimant had no intention of returning to the United States as his faith in the United States justice system was shaken. Even though the charges of drug trafficking had been dismissed against him, he feared legal problems if he returned and he did not have the financial means to deal with them.\n(c) The claimant's co-counsel has presented evidence indicating that the United States Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS) authorities can deem the claimant's permanent resident status to be abandoned. There is a suggestion, too, that an absence of one year can lead the INS authorities to that conclusion, if not accompanied by a valid re-entry permit. In some cases, even this may not be enough. Counsel referred to a case where an INS judge found that a plaintiff with a valid re-entry permit to have abandoned his United States residency, simply because he mostly worked and lived abroad.2\n(d) In the case at bar, the claimant did not file nor attempt to file a re-entry permit. Neither did he, during the 13 years, make a single attempt to go back to the United States nor has he filed any United States tax returns during this period. In fact, his fianc\u00e9e, who is an American citizen, traveled to Colombia, married him there and began raising a family with him in Colombia.\n(e) The MCI has referred to the rights of a permanent resident in the United States being congruent with the rights of a permanent resident in Canada. We know that individuals in Canada can lose their landed status if they relinquish their residence here.3 The United States is no different.\n(f) The MCI has not produced evidence to indicate that the claimant's card is still valid or can be renewed. A few lines from the INS would have sufficed. The Minister's attempt to obtain them proved unsuccessful. The Minister argues that a presumption of valid status flows from this silence. I do not see how the silence can be necessarily interpreted in only one way.\n(g) The MCI makes the further argument of the fact that a document's expiry date is not an impediment to exclusion under Article 1E of the Convention. Reference is made to case law.4 The case law is, however, particular to certain circumstances, none of which are relevant here. In one case (Choovak5), the refugee claimant deliberately let her residence status expire; in the other (Nepete6), the claimant produced no evidence that he would be denied a re-entry visa.\nHaving found that Article 1E of the Convention does not apply to the claimant, I now proceed to consider his claim for protection in Canada.\nAllegations\nThe claimant was involved in the business of buying and selling cattle. He was subjected to a series of extortions, beginning in XXXXX 1987. The claimant simply ignored the calls. In XXXX 1989, his father received another extortion demand with the threat that the family would be harmed if the demand is not met. The demand was ignored. The claimant was followed by motorcycles on the highway, leading to his jeep getting overturned. Worried about his son's near-miss, his father died of a heart attack a few days later. Shortly thereafter, shots were fired at family members, fortunately missing them.\nThe claimant changed residence. Another call came in 1990, this time ostensibly from the M-19 group. The claimant changed residence again.\nNothing happened till the middle of 1998 when an extortion demand was made by an anonymous caller for the large sum of 300 million pesos. The family was threatened if the demand was not met. The claimant decided to send his family out of the country.\nBy year's end, the demand had diminished to 200 million pesos. The claimant, however, was given a week to comply. He moved houses and began planning his departure from the country. He was able to leave in XXXXX 1999.\nANALYSIS\nCredibility\nCredibility is the first issue for consideration. There were a few implausibilities but on a balance of probabilities, I find the claimant to be credible. Firstly, the implausibilites are not such as to impugn the claimant's credibility. Secondly, the claimant's demeanor was straightforward. Thirdly, the testimony was internally consistent.\nThe main implausibility has to do with the inexplicable failure of the claimant's tormenters to contact him between 1990 and 1998, even though he was not in hiding. The assumption being made here, however, is that the tormenters were one and the same. That need not be. Extortion is practised by a variety of parties - by the guerrillas, the paramilitaries and criminals. Consequently, I am not overly concerned that the claimant was not contacted, by the gap in years, given that the identity of the persecutors was not clear.\nExtortion in the Colombian context, has the potential of serious harm, including a possible risk to life. In examining the conditions in Colombia, we find from the documentary evidence that Colombia has been described as a country \"in profound crisis, where society is breaking down.\"7 A poll conducted in 1999 indicated that 56 per cent of the population wished to leave the country for good.8 One of the main reasons for doing so is the spate of kidnappings and accompanying extortion that takes place. In 1999, there were 3000 kidnappings, 73 per cent more than the previous year. Francisco Santos, the head of Free Country, a Colombian Non-Governmental Organization (NGO), stated that the abductions were carried out by guerrillas, right-wing paramilitaries and common criminals. Eduardo Delgadillo, who authored the study \"Kidnappings in Columbia\" said that extortion was a main goal for such abductions, particularly for guerrillas and groups of criminals.9 Groups of common criminals are known to operate as \"para-guerilla groups,\" carrying out the abduction and handing the victim to the guerrillas. In some cases, groups may network in such a way that multi-ransoms may be demanded.10\nMilitary intelligence believes that the guerillas will increasingly focus on urban areas to raise a $600 million a year group. The report pointed out that kidnappings take place at the rate of 10 per day and that extortions (or protection rackets) have doubled.11 While the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia otherwise known as Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC) has openly declared and threatened to kidnap any unco-operative millionaire,12 the paramilitaries too focus their efforts on businessmen and business employees.13 Another Colombian NGO, Fundacion Pais Libre, indicated that in the first quarter of 2000, the kidnapping victims could be divided as follows: Businesspersons (130), agricultural sector (76), employees (63), minors (60), police (27) and engineers (21). It also indicated that FARC demands a peace tax of 5 per cent on all construction projects under the pain of kidnapping the engineers or attacking work sites.14\nWith the number of killings and atrocities committed by all sides in this brutal conflict, it is clearly understood that kidnappings and extortion threats can lead to death or forced disappearance, as has indeed happened.15\nThe claimant's story of extortion and fear is consistent with the documentary evidence. As a businessman in Colombia, he belongs to a category marked for extortion. It is the claimant's contention that the State cannot protect him in the circumstances. Francisco Santos, the head of Free Country, accused the government of not taking appropriate steps to combat the problem. Colombia's security forces, while quite large, are neither tactically impressive nor strategically on target. The documentary evidence, taken as a whole, leaves one with a distinct impression that they are overwhelmed and do not have an infrastructure or an ability to deal with guerilla kidnappings.\nDetermination\nAs the identity of the extortionists is open to question, the claimant cannot be found to be a Convention refugee. However, the claimant was targeted for extortion by reason of his being a well-to-do businessman which in the Colombian context, amounts to a risk to life.\nCONCLUSION\nI find the claimant to be a person in need of protection by virtue of Section 97 of the new Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I accept his claim.\n\"Harindar Aulach\"\nHarindar Aulach\nDATED at Toronto, Ontario this 11th day of February 2003.\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - PERSON IN NEED OF PROTECTION - RISK TO LIFE - EXTORTION - STATE PROTECTION - MALE - POSITIVE - COLOMBIA\n1 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v.

The male claimant claims to have a well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of his neighbours and the police because of his membership in a particular social group, that being bisexual men. His wife claims that she and their children have also been targeted by the same agents because of her husband's sexual orientation and they base their claims on their membership in a particular social group, that being family.\nThe claimant alleged that after two of his neighbours saw him kissing his boyfriend, XXXXXXXX, while coming out of a bar on XXXX, 2001, everyone in his area, including his wife and family, were told about this. He alleged that he was subsequently beaten by neighbours while policemen watched on XXXXX, 2001 and by policemen when he went to report this to the police station on XXXX, 2001. He alleged that he received threatening, insulting calls during the month of August 2001. He alleged that, on XXXXXXXX, 2001, he and his boyfriend XXXXXX were caught kissing and hugging in the park at night, and were beaten and raped. He alleged that he recognized the voices of the perpetrators as being those of one of his neighbours, and one of the policemen who had attacked him previously. He alleged that he left Costa Rica for Canada on XXXXXXX, 2001, having secured for personal problems, a one-year leave of absence from his position as a school teacher, now being extended until XXXXXXX, 2004. He alleged that state protection would not be forthcoming to him and his family if he were to return to Costa Rica. He alleged that he has not had any homosexual relationship with any man in Canada because the language barrier has prevented him from finding a male sexual partner.\nThe female claimant alleged that after her husband's departure on XXXXX, 2001, her house was stoned by neighbours, and her children were mocked at school regarding their father's sexual orientation. She alleges that the police told her that they could not help her as she had to be a person of good character. She alleged that she and her children came to Canada on December 3, 2001. At the port of entry (POE),2 she claimed not being able to return to Costa Rica because of the threats she received, of\nkidnapping her children, and because of the high crime rate in her area. She claims that she is prepared to accept her husband having sexual relationships with men.\nThe determinative issues in these claims is whether state protection would be forthcoming. In making this assessment, the panel considered the adult claimants' oral and written testimony, the psychological report, all the submitted evidence, and counsel's submissions. The panel closely perused the documentary evidence pertaining to sexual minorities, the police, mechanisms for lodging complaints of police abuse, and the level of democracy in Costa Rica.\nThe extensive documentary evidence indicates that there is a thriving gay community in Costa Rica, and that the community is not the target of systematic persecution by the authorities or by society at large. Gay-oriented resorts, businesses, and organizations continue to exist in Costa Rica, and there are a number of gay-oriented websites including The Gay and Lesbian Guide to Costa Rica, which compiles information on gay organizations, including personal accounts of life and levels of tolerance or incidents in the country, gay-oriented businesses, publications, discussion groups and bulletin boards.3 There are many homosexual organizations, two magazines\n3\/4 Gente 10 and Del Mismo Sexo 3\/4, and a community paper called Gayness.4 The report contains a link and references to the Asociaci\u00f3n Creativa de Empresarios (ACES), on which it states: \"The LesBiGay Business Group ACES has ongoing projects to promote Costa Rica as the wonderful gay\/lesbian tourist destination that it is, as well as projects that support the well-being of the local gay communities in Costa Rica.\"5 A website called Gaymocracia is dedicated to information on the political and human rights situation of members of the lesbian, bisexual, gay, and transgender (LBGT) community in Costa Rica.6\nThe XXXXXX XXXXXXX XXXX XXXXX XXXXX in San Jos\u00e9, XXXXX XXXX, a XXXXXXXXXX and former XXXXX of the now defunct gay organization XXXXXXX, stated that he was unaware of any cases involving gay men being harassed, assaulted, raped or extorted to pay a bribe by police.7 A further April 2002 check of various media sources and organizations in Costa Rica and abroad could also not find such evidence among reports published between 2000 and 2002.8 Mr. XXXX further stated that Costa Rica has a \"live and let live\" attitude towards gays and that discrimination is not a government or police policy. He also spoke of the difficulties that gay adolescents who are dependent on their families, the school, and the church experience until they are able to accept their sexual identity.9 He stated that in 1997 the Supreme Court outlawed bar raids, and ordered that the government provide the new AIDS medication to 500 people, most of them gay men.10 He also recognizes the existing paradox between the legally protected and thriving lives of gays in Costa Rica supported by peer culture but condemned and vilified by a national culture.11\nCounsel submitted an e mail12 dated XXXX, 2001 from XXXXX, XXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX of the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission stating that the XXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXX, is an XXXXXX who has lived in Costa Rica for a few years, and that he was fired from XXXXXXX after working there for some years. The panel finds that this information about the XXXX being an XXXXX living in Costa Rica, who was allegedly fired from XXXXXXX and is now the XXXXX XXXXXX, in no way detracts or diminishes the trustworthiness of his information about gays in Costa Rica. Mr. XXXXX is a XXXXXXX who has lived in Costa Rica for XXX years and has worked in non-government organizations providing support to sexual minorities and people living with AIDS.13\nThe panel noted that in 1998, the Archbishop of San Jos\u00e9, a local priest and the President of the country, have on separate occasions spoken against gay festivals and gay tourism in Costa Rica.14 However, this anti-gay rhetoric prompted formal complaints before the Supreme Court against the Archbishop and the priest and before the Human Rights Ombudsman against the President by a group of gay organizations and non-gay supporters.15 Furthermore, the Ombudswomen's Office criticized the President and the Archbishop for having violated laws when they made these anti-gay remarks.16\nA sign of growing public acceptance of gays is that presidential candidates, Antonio de Santi and Miguel Corrales, have both been interviewed by the gay press and have each indicated that they uphold a position of balance and respect toward the gay community.17\nThe Ombudsman of Costa Rica includes persons with a \"distinct sexual preference\" as one of the various vulnerable groups that face or could face a violation of their rights.18 The Ombudsman reports that its special protection directorate, with a team of eight lawyers, assists vulnerable groups to achieve full enjoyment of their rights before state institutions and with society.19 The latest report of this directorate indicates that a complaint regarding discriminatory attitudes of local government officials was favourably resolved by the Office of the Ombudsman.20 A complaint raised in 1998 by the Movimiento Gay-L\u00e9sbico 5 de Abril, regarding a homophobic statement made by the President of Costa Rica, prompted the Ombudsman to issue a recommendation to the President asking him to act according to his constitutional mandate, and ensure that all state institutions practice tolerance towards alternative lifestyles and respect the\nfundamental rights of all persons without exception.21 In a 1999 complaint of police abuse in the form of arbitrary detention, as well as verbal and physical abuse in Alajuela, the Ombudsman issued a recommendation to the Public Ministry asking for disciplinary action against the police officers involved in the abuse, the addition of sensitivity training at the National School of Police, and a special effort involving the Alajuela police command and other institutions under the Ministry's jurisdiction for more inclusive practices.22\nIn addition to the Ombudsman, the Constitutional Court can help protect rights of sexual minorities if they are threatened.23 There are also the following non-government organizations involved in these endeavours: Centre for Research and Promotion of Human Rights in Central America (CIPAC), Agua Buena, Movimiento 5 de Abril and the Latin American Institute of Health Education and Prevention.24 The years of repression against sexual minorities from the late 1980s to the early 1990s motivated many owners of bars that catered to the gay and lesbian population to organize for political action against repression of their clientele, and that is how many of the groups fighting for the rights of sexual minorities emerged.25\nWith regards to the police in general, complaints of police abuse of authority or misconduct have declined as the government continued implementation of the 1994 Police Code and the Law for Strengthening the Civilian Police which took effect on March 23, 2001.26 Furthermore, if police abuse or misconduct occurs, an effective mechanism for lodging complaints exists through the Ombudsman's Office which serves as a recourse to citizens who have complaints about violations of their civil and human rights and about deficiencies in public and private infrastructure.27 It investigates complaints and, when appropriate, initiates suits against officials.28 The Ombudsman is elected by the Legislative Assembly for a four-year renewable term.29 His office is part of the legislative branch ensuring a high degree of independence from the executive branch.30 The law provides for a functional, administrative, and judicial independence of the Ombudsman's Office.31\nAccording to correspondence from the Executive Director32 of the Central American Human Rights Research and Promotion Centre (CIPAC) of San Jos\u00e9, although the Ombudsman's Office has a high degree of credibility with Costa Ricans, their decisions are not binding, as it is the state that decides whether their recommendations are accepted. The panel finds that this would not detract from the efficacy of the Ombudsman's work, as it is their role to investigate and refer serious cases of abuse to the Public Prosecutor. There is no persuasive evidence before the panel that the Public Prosecutor does not prosecute cases of police misconduct or abuse of authority concerning complaints from sexual minorities. The panel further notes that, according to the International Lesbian and Gay Association's \"World Legal Survey\",33 decisions made by the Ombudsman are legally binding Tri\u00e1ngulo Rosa press release, March 1996).\nIn the cases at bar, the male claimant alleged that when he reported to the police station his first assault by neighbours while policemen watched, they arrested him, insulted him and beat him, so he feared reporting his second assault by neighbours and a police officer. He claimed that he did not report these incidents to the Ombudsman's Office because, according to his general knowledge of Costa Rican laws, and what has happened to others, one has to present a report to the police station at the same time and he was afraid to do so. The documentary evidence does not support this.\nGiven the remedy available to deal with police abuse or misconduct, the panel finds that the claimant ought to have pursued the option open to him, by reporting the police misconduct and abuse to the Ombudsman.\nGiven that Costa Rica34 is a longstanding, stable, constitutional democracy, with an independent judiciary providing effective means to deal with individual cases of abuse, the claimants must do more than simply show that they went to some members of the police force and that their efforts were unsuccessful.35 The more democratic the state's institutions, the more the claimants must have done to exhaust all the courses of action open to them.36 There is no persuasive evidence that indicates that if the claimant had\ntaken the appropriate steps by complaining to the Ombudsman, with respect to the incidents which he alleged caused him to have a well-founded fear of persecution, that the state would have been unable or unwilling to protect him. The panel finds that the claimant has not discharged the onus of showing clear and convincing proof of the state's inability or unwillingness to protect him.\nWith regards to the female's claim, the panel found that her explanations for omitting to mention in her Personal Information Form37 (PIF) kidnapping threats against her children not reasonable. First, she said that perhaps she forgot because she feels protected here. Then she provided very unclear testimony about when the threatening calls occurred. The panel did not find it reasonable that she would report the rock throwing at her house to the police, yet not report the kidnapping threats against her children. Similarly, it is not credible that she would mention rock throwing in her PIF yet fail to mention the threat to kidnap her children. Further, given that she was represented by legal counsel and that other amendments were tendered, her explanation of forgetting is not reasonable. The panel finds that the claimant was embellishing in an attempt to\nbuttress her claim. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to find that the female claimant and the minor children face a risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment. Even if these kidnapping threats were to have been found credible, one would expect the claimant to report such a serious matter to the police, and then to the Ombudsman if she felt that her denunciation was not being taken seriously by the police.\nGiven that the panel finds that there is state protection available to the adult claimants, the same finding applies to the minors.\nBased on the foregoing analysis, the panel concludes that the claimant, his wife and their four children are not Convention refugees.\nGiven the finding of available state protection for the claimants, the panel also finds that they are not persons in need of protection pursuant to sections 97(1)a) and (b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\nAccordingly, the panel rejects their claims for refugee protection.\n\"E.S.

He claimed refugee status four days later, on August 11, 2001. He stated that he fears persecution in his country by reason of imputed political opinion. He also claimed refugee protection because he believes he would be subject personally to a danger of torture, to a risk to his life, or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nSummary of alleged facts\nThe claimant was born in Kinshasa, where he spent his childhood. Later, around 1975, he went with his parents to the city of XXXX in South Kivu, which has been his home since then. Actually, his parents were from South Kivu. There they ran a food and clothing business and a potato and corn farm and raised livestock. The claimant worked in the business with his father. When his father died on XXXXXX, 2000, the claimant became the sole owner. He stated that all of North and South Kivu is occupied and governed by the Rassemblement congolais pour la d\u00e9mocratie (RCD), a rebel group made up of Congolese and Rwandan militiamen. To stock his business, the claimant would buy goods in Bukavu, the largest city in Kivu. Beginning in the year 2000, he was not always able to go and buy rice and beans in Bukavu because there were armed groups on the roads, which created a situation of complete insecurity.\nOn XXXXX, 2001, a group of RCD militiamen went to the claimant's house and demanded that he hand over all of his money and anything that would bring in some money. The claimant, whose business was right in front of his family home, asked them to come into his store to discuss the matter. Once in the store, the claimant said that he did not have money, and he was hit on the head. He then told the militiamen where they could find the money, that is, US$528, which was, he said, all of his savings. They also took some goods and left.\nOn XXXX and XX, 2001, the claimant went to see other businessmen in the area, among them XXXXXX and XXXXXX, in order to create an association to denounce the behaviour of the RCD militiamen. The association was established on July 10, 2001, and XXXXXXXX became its XXXXXX. He was responsible for drafting regulations so that the association would have legal status.\nOn XXXXX, 2001, militiamen abducted the XXXXXXX of the association. The claimant tried unsuccessfully to find him.\nOn XXXX, 2001, around 10:15 p.m., the claimant was arrested and taken into the bush, after having been interrogated as to his activities and tortured.\nOnce in the bush, the claimant saw the corpses of men and women. He stated that a number of people were taken into the bush to be executed that evening. When the people who were about to be executed were brought before four militiamen, one of them approached a militiaman to ask for his pardon. A first shot was fired and then a second, and the claimant's first reaction was to run. He said that he disappeared into the forest and spent the night in a tree. The next morning, he headed towards Lake XXXXXXX, where he took a pirogue to XXXXX, Tanzania. There he met a Tanzanian by the name of XXXXXX who paid all of his travel expenses.\nThese are essentially the facts that were brought to the attention of the panel by the claimant, who was the only person to testify at the hearing.\nAnalysis\nHaving heard the testimony and analysed all of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant is a citizen of the DRC, as he alleged. His identity was established by his birth certificate and his State diploma.\nHowever, the panel cannot accept the claim for refugee protection for the following reasons.\nFirst of all, in not producing any documents to establish that he was a merchant, the claimant did not discharge the burden of proof that rested on him. This evidence was of the utmost importance because the alleged persecution had a direct nexus to his status as a merchant.\nEven though the Board had asked him well before the hearing to provide evidence of his business activities, as indicated in the screening, filed as Exhibit A-2, the claimant did not do so. Here is how he answered questions regarding this matter: \"[Translation] In my country, it is difficult to obtain documents, but the store was registered properly.\"\nAt a later point, he said that his wife had sent him his State diploma from Gabon. When asked why he did not have any business papers and whether his wife could not have sent them to him in the same way that she had sent him his State diploma, he replied: \"[Translation] The type of document that you want me to produce, I was unable to obtain when I fled.\"\nIt is strange that the claimant did not ask his wife to send him his business registration papers or other documents, such as purchase invoices, that could have established that he was a businessman. The claimant's responses failed to establish that this evidence, which was absolutely necessary in the circumstances, was nonexistent and inaccessible. Having failed to produce the evidence, he has not discharged the burden of proof upon him. His credibility in relation to the subsequent incidents was thereby adversely affected.\nMoreover, the claimant alleged that a rebel group abducted him from his home on the evening of XXXXX, 2001 and then took him into the bush to execute him; he stated that he had been able to run away and escape without being shot by the militiamen, who had apparently fired when he fled. The claimant was evasive and did not want to indicate whether the militiamen, who had been directly in front of him, had fired in his direction the moment that he had fled running. Here is how he answered the questions that were put to him:\n[TRANSLATION]\nQ. You were not guarded? I understand that there were militiamen in front of you.\nA. Yes, the \"militiaman\" that was in front of us shot at the person who was approaching to ask not to be killed. The person shouted; I heard first one shot fired and then a second, and I ran.\nQ. While you were running, did no one shoot in your direction?\nA. Yes, I heard shots; I disappeared into the forest.\nQ. The gunfire continued, but you were not shot?\nA. No, I fled, and it was in the middle of the night.\nOf course, the fact that he was not killed or seriously wounded during this incident is one thing, but the panel does not believe that he would not even be grazed by the militiamen's bullets, especially since there were allegedly many militiamen present. According to his written version of events, he was arrested on the evening of XXXXX, 2001 by a large number of militiamen who arrived in two jeeps and took him into the bush.\nSimilarly, it is implausible that the militiamen, who allegedly took the claimant into the bush to execute him, would have left him untied so that he was able to run away so quickly and easily that none of the bullets fired at him hit him. This account is too incredible to be true.\nIt is also odd that a perfect stranger, a Tanzanian he apparently met by chance, would organize and pay for his trip without setting any conditions. The claimant alleged that he did not know how much the trip had cost him and that he had not even asked, not even to satisfy his own curiosity as to whether it was a gift or a loan.\nThat is the type of attitude and behaviour that tends to demonstrate that the claimant is not a truthful witness; a person does not pay out such large sums of money to help a stranger without establishing the modalities and conditions that are associated with such a transaction.\nMoreover, apart from his State diploma and birth certificate, issued in Kinshasa on XXXXX, 1992 and XXXXX, 1994, respectively (Exhibit R-2, filed in a bundle), the claimant did not produce any documents to establish that he was in South Kivu during the period of alleged persecution. The lack of this evidence, which could have been established by his \"business papers,\" among other documents, adversely affected his credibility. Neither did he produce the itinerary for his trip, which could have been established by means of his plane tickets and his boarding passes.\nIn light of the above, the claimant has not established that he had the status of a merchant; that he did business in XXXX, South Kivu; or that he was in that region during the period of alleged persecution. It also apparent that the alleged incidents did not occur and that he is not credible.\nDanger of torture and risk to life\nGiven that he was not found to be credible, sections 97(1)(a) and (b) regarding \"persons in need of protection\" do not apply in this case.\nConclusion\nFor these reasons, the panel determines that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is not a \"Convention refugee\" or a \"person in need of protection,\" as defined in sections 96 and 97(1)(a) and (b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\"Georges Gustave\"\nGeorges Gustave\nDATED at Toronto, this 7th day of March 2003\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - POLITICAL OPINION - CREDIBILITY - DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE - MALE - NEGATIVE - DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO\n7\nTA1-27855\nTA1-27855\n",

He has also claimed to be a person in need of protection pursuant to sections 97(1)(a) and 97(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\nAllegations\nAccording to the narrative section of his Personal Information Form (PIF),1 the claimant was arrested on XXXXXX, 1997 in Kinshasa because of his relationship to his eldest brother, XXXXX. His brother, the former XXXXX of financial management for the XXXXXX branch, was arrested on XXXXX, 1997. The claimant was taken to the Kinshasa penitentiary and rehabilitation centre, where he was interrogated regarding his ties with dignitaries from the deposed Mobutu regime, who were accused of embezzlement and mismanagement. The claimant was charged with complicity in the acts of which his brother had been accused. The claimant was convicted and sentenced to seven years in prison.\nOn XXXXX, 2001, the claimant escaped from prison with the help of a security guard who was his uncle's friend. He crossed the river to Congo-Brazzaville that same day. On XXXXX, 2001, he left the country for France. He left France for the United States on August 22, 2001, and on August 26, 2001, he arrived at the Canadian border, where he made a claim for refugee protection.\nAnalysis\nThe claimant signed an Acquisition of Information Form (AIF) on September 18, 2002, in which he authorized the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) to obtain information regarding his status in France. The claimant's full name and date of birth were provided to the French authorities as part of the acquisition of information request.\nOn November 27, 2002, the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) received a response to its information request. This was information that the IRB's Specific Information Research Unit (SIRU) obtained from the French Embassy in Ottawa.2 The information received from the French Embassy was as follows:\n[TRANSLATION]\nSubject: Mr. XXXXXXXXX\nFurther to your letter of October 3, 2002, I am pleased to be able to provide you with the following information regarding XXXXXXXXXX:\nThe person concerned entered France illegally on XXXXXXX, 1996. He was granted provisional entry, valid from XXXXX, 1999 to XXXXX, 1999. The identification Mr. XXXXXXX presented was a passport issued in Kinshasa. The person concerned made a refugee claim with OFPRA (Office Fran\u00e7ais de Protection des R\u00e9fugi\u00e9s et Apatrides) on April 25, 1996. The claim was rejected on XXXXX, 1996. He appealed this decision on XXXXX, 1996. On XXXXX, 1996, he was notified that his appeal had been dismissed.\nAt his hearing before the RPD, the claimant was shown the information from the French authorities. He dismissed the information and maintained that he had left the DRC in 2001 and had never lived in France. He said that the name of the person described by the French authorities, XXXXXXX, was different from his own, XXXXXX. He therefore claimed that they were not the same person.\nAt the panel's request, SIRU again communicated with the French Embassy in order to clarify the information received. On January 29, 2003, the Embassy responded as follows:3\n[TRANSLATION]\nSubject: XXXXXX\nUpon verification, the information request and the response from the French authorities indeed concern Mr. XXXXX, born on XXXXX, 1972 in Kinshasa, and not Mr. XXXXXX, as was incorrectly indicated in my e-mail of November 25, 2002. Please note that the spelling in the subject line of the message is correct.\nThe response from the French Embassy was sent to the claimant's counsel on February 10, 2003.4 The panel informed her that she had two weeks to send comments or new submissions with respect to the information provided by the French authorities. As of February 24, 2003, no new submissions had been received from the claimant and the decision was taken under reserve.\nIn the panel's opinion, it is neither reasonable nor credible that the person described by the French authorities, who has the same first name, XXXXX, hypenated surname, XXXXXXX, date of birth, XXXXX, 1976, and place of birth, Kinshasa, as the claimant, is not the claimant. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is the person referred to by the French authorities, that he left the DRC and entered France in 1996. As he was granted provisional entry into France in 1999,5 the panel also finds that he was in France from 1996 until 1999.\nThe incidents of persecution alleged by the claimant in his PIF took place in the DRC between XXXX 1997 and XXXXX 2001. However, as the panel found that the claimant was in France and not in the DRC during the relevant period, the panel consequently finds that the incidents mentioned in the claimant's PIF did not occur. The claimant did not adduce any credible or trustworthy evidence to explain why someone with the same first name, surname, date of birth and place of birth was identified as a refugee claimant in France.\nMoreover, the claimant did not submit any travel documents to establish his itinerary from the DRC to Canada. When he made his claim for refugee protection, the claimant indicated that he had destroyed the false passport he used while travelling from Congo-Brazzaville to the United States via France.6 However, according to the notes taken by an immigration officer, the claimant stated that he had returned the false passport to his uncle's friend.7 When he was confronted at the hearing with the contradiction between his own statements regarding the passport, the claimant provided a third version of the facts, stating that he had given the passport he used for travelling to a man he met by chance at the airport in New York.\nThe claimant's testimony regarding the passport was contradictory and devoid of credibility. In Elazi,8 the Federal Court agreed with the Convention Refugee Determination Division of the IRB when it drew a negative inference from the destruction of a passport by a claimant and the failure to submit travel documents:\n?17? I take this opportunity to add that it is entirely reasonable for the Refugee Division to attach great importance to a claimant's passport and his air ticket. In my opinion, these documents are essential to establish the claimant's identity and his journey to come to Canada. Unless it can be assumed that a refugee status claimant is actually a refugee, it seems unreasonable to me to ignore the loss of these documents without a valid explanation. In my view, it is too easy for a claimant to simply state that he has lost these documents or the facilitator has taken them. If the Refugee Division insists on these documents being produced, the facilitators may have to change their methods.\n?18? Minimizing the importance of the passport and air ticket as documents to be produced or ignoring their non-submission for all sorts of reasons in my opinion only serves to encourage all those whose only purpose is to take advantage of a system which is intended solely to enable genuine refugees to come to Canada.\nThe panel considered the evidence adduced by the claimant, including his oral testimony and the documents he submitted.9 The panel finds that the claimant was not in the DRC during the period of alleged persecution because he was living in France during that time. For this reason, the panel attaches no probative value to the documents the claimant submitted. The panel also finds that the claimant's testimony, as a whole, was not credible.10\nConclusion\nFor all these reasons, and after having considered all the evidence, the panel determines that the claimant has not established that he has a well-founded fear of persecution were he to return to the DRC. The panel also determines that the claimant is not a person in need of protection because there are no substantial grounds for believing that he would be subject personally to a danger of torture if he returned to the DRC. Moreover, the panel determines that the claimant is not a person in need of protection in that, if he returned to the DRC, he would not be subject to a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nConsequently, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nThe panel also finds that the claimant's testimony, as a whole, was not credible. As the panel finds that the claimant did not adduce any credible or trustworthy evidence on which it could have based itself, it consequently determines, pursuant to section 107(2) of the IRPA, that there is no credible basis for his claim for refugee protection.\nKarin Michnick\nKarin Michnick\nDATED at Toronto, this 11th day of March 2003\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE - IDENTITY - CREDIBILITY - NO CREDIBLE BASIS - MALE - NEGATIVE - DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO\n1 Exhibit R-1.\n2 Exhibit A-2\n3 Exhibit A-3.\n4 Letter sent to Lisa McCullough by the Refugee Protection Officer (RPO).\n5 Exhibit A-2.\n6 Exhibit M-1, Information on Admissibility to Canada and Claim to be a Convention Refugee Form, Question # 34.\n7 Exhibit M-1, Notification of Claim to be a Convention Refugee, Officer's Comments.\n8 Elazi, Iseikete Simon v.

XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX). Both are Sinhalese Christian citizens of Sri Lanka. The hearing for these claims was held pursuant to section 170(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act1 (IRPA) on August 28, 2003 at Toronto, Ontario.\nThe claimants are alleging the need for refugee protection because of their religion. They also claim a risk to their lives because of the volatile situation in Sri Lanka.\nIn order to be determined to be Convention refugees or persons in need of protection, the evidence must establish that the claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution for a Convention ground or must establish that their removal to their country of nationality would subject them personally (a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or (b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nBoth claimants were Catholics at birth and became \"Born Again Christians\" in the early 1990s. Both indicated that they felt intimidated when worshipping at their church, which was located in a Buddhist neighbourhood of XXXXXX, because Buddhists citizens who lived close to their church would complain about the noise level of loud singing and clapping during their services. The neighbours would sometimes heckle the worshippers and sometimes stones would be thrown at the church and the tires of the parishioners' cars would be deflated. The female claimant testified that after she converted, she was ostracized by her Catholic parish, and the parish priest at one point tried to run her over with his car. She declared that she did not report the priest because police would only have gotten involved if she were hit, which she was not.\nBoth claimants also testified that the XXXXXXXXXX bombing in XXXXXX in 1997 deeply affected them, because they were not able to get in touch with each other for a few hours. They stated that they were not in the immediate neighbourhood of the blast. The claimants indicated they are in need of protection because they lived in the uncertainty of a civil war situation for 20 years and they do not believe that the ongoing peace efforts will resolve the problem.\nAnalysis:\nIdentity:\nThe claimants submitted their passport at the hearing; therefore, I accepted their identity and nationality. I also accepted their religious background as \"Born Again Christians\" as they submitted persuasive documents2 in regards to that issue.\nCredibility:\nI found both claimants credible witnesses; they presented their testimony without contradiction or apparent embellishments. However, I find their allegation that they are in need of protection is not supported by the documentary evidence before me.\nDo the claimants have good grounds for fearing persecution because of their religion?\nThe International Religious Freedom Report 3 comments as follows;\nThe Constitution accords Buddhism the \"foremost place,\" but it is not recognized as the state religion. The Constitution also provides for the right of members of other faiths to practice their religion freely, and the Government generally respects this right in practice.\nAnd continues\nDespite generally amicable relations among persons of different faiths, there has been occasional resistance by Buddhists to Christian church activity, and in particular to the activities of evangelical Christian denominations. While the courts generally have upheld the right of evangelical Christian groups to worship and to construct facilities to house their congregations, the Government limits the number of foreign religious workers granted temporary residence permits. During the December 2001 parliamentary elections, 12 supporters of a Muslim-based political party were killed in 2 separate incidents. However, the killings appear to have been politically, rather than religiously, motivated.\nIt further points out\nDespite the constitutional preference for Buddhism, major religious festivals of all faiths are celebrated as national holidays.\nThe Government has established councils for interfaith understanding.4\nIt shows that\nSome evangelical Christians, who constitute less than 1 percent of the population, have expressed concern that their efforts at proselytizing often are met with hostility and harassment by the local Buddhist clergy and others opposed to their work. They sometimes complain that the Government tacitly condones such harassment, but there is no evidence to support this claim. Some Christian organizations claim that they continue to face opposition at the local level in rural areas but state that legal action or the threat of legal action generally has resulted in their being allowed to continue their activities.5\nAnd continues that\nDiscrimination based on religious differences is much less common than discrimination based on ethnic group affiliation. In general, the members of the various faiths tend to be tolerant of each other's religious beliefs. On occasion, evangelical Christians, or anyone perceived to be attempting to convert Buddhists to Christianity, have been harassed by Buddhist monks. Some Christian organizations complain that the Government tacitly condones such harassment, although there is no evidence to support this claim (see Section I).\nThere are credible reports that in some rural areas members of Christian organizations have been physically assaulted for alleged attempts to convert Buddhists. In one instance, in April, a Buddhist monk was reported to have assaulted two members of the Salvation Army, claiming that they were attempting to convert a person they were meeting with. The Salvation Army members were shaken by the incident but not seriously injured. In some rural areas, small Christian organizations have stated that they do not report cases of harassment in order to avoid additional attention. In other areas, religious leaders have found that a peaceful coexistence can be maintained as long as the leaders of all of the religious communities maintain a dialog.6\nCounsel submitted Internet printouts in regards to claims of persecution of evangelical Christians.7 It was the claimants' own testimony that they are aware of attacks in rural areas of Sri Lanka, which is confirmed by the articles and also mentioned in the above report. They declared that their parish in XXXXXX was not actively involved in proselytizing and neither were they personally. The intimidation they endured is described in the above summary of their testimony. They were not prevented from worship, neither were they refused jobs or promotions because of their religion; on the contrary, the male claimant received rewards for his good job performance. There is no evidence that they were denied housing, education and medical attention because of their religion. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that they would not get state protection, if needed. Even though I recognize that it must have been difficult and embarrassing for the female claimant to be ostracized by her parish, however, that is a hardship which does not trigger a need for protection. Neither is the one-time event of the parish priest trying to run her over in the early 1990s, because nothing else ensued. I also recognize that it would be disturbing to restrict the loudness of singing and clapping during a religious service in order to pacify the neighbours, however, that also is a hardship and not persecution. Based on the above, I find that the initial question has to be answered in the negative.\nGeneralized Risk:\nI find that the testimony of the claimants indicate that they fear the general conditions in XXXXXX associated with a civil war situation and terrorist activities.8 They were asked whether they would conclude that the entire population of XXXXXX is in need of protection and they replied in the affirmative. However, as required by section 97(1)(b)(ii) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, claimants have to established an identifiable risk that is distinguishable from that of the general population. I find that the claimants fear a generalized risk, one that is faced by all citizens of XXXXX, or even Sri Lanka. There was no evidence adduced to support a finding that the claimants fear a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture.\nConclusion:\nFor the above reasons these claims have to fail. Therefore, after having considered the totality of the evidence, the relevant statutory provisions and jurisprudence, the Refugee Protection Division rejects the claims of XXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXX (a.k.a. XXXXXXXXXXXX). They are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.\n\"Elke Homsi\"\nElke Homsi\nDATED at Toronto this 29th day of August 2003.\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - PERSECUTION - RELIGION - PERSON IN NEED OF PROTECTION - RISK TO LIFE - GENERALIZED RISK - STATE PROTECTION - NEGATIVE - MALE - FEMALE - SRI LANKA\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Exhibit C-4.\n3 Exhibit R-2, United States Department of State, International Religious Freedom Report - 2002 Sri Lanka, \"Introduction\"\n4 Ibid., section II, \"Status of Religious Freedom - Legal\/Policy Framework\".\n5 Ibid., \"Restriction on Religious Freedom\".\n6 Ibid., section III, \"Societal Attitudes\".\n7 Exhibit C-2.\n8 Exhibit R-1 Supplementary RPO Disclosure Package - Sri Lanka March 2003 - General Information Tab 1\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n7\nTA2-01333\nTA2-01334\n",

The claimant is a thirty-year-old citizen of St. Lucia.1\nIn order to be determined to be a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, the evidence must establish that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution for a Convention ground or must establish that their removal to their country of nationality would subject them personally either (a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or (b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nThe claimant bases her fear of persecution on gender violence. She fears the man with whom she lived for two years. In the narrative of her Personal Information Form (PIF)2 the claimant outlines the basis of her claim. The oral testimony of the claimant was consistent with her narrative. In oral testimony, she provided more information regarding her experiences and her attempts to obtain state protection. On one occasion, she filed a report with the police and was told that the man she lived with would be summonsed to court. However, the summons was never issued. She also telephoned the police on several occasions. The police responded but did not arrest or charge the man but instead attempted to be conciliatory and cajole him into stopping his abusive behaviour.\nThe claimant presented sufficient evidence to satisfy the issues that were outlined at the outset of the hearing. Credibility is satisfied by her consistent and straightforward testimony. The issue of re-availment, her brief return to Saint Lucia for two days to take her mother home after she became ill in Barbados, was satisfactorily explained. Delay in making this claim is explained by the claimant having come to Canada to study at University in Halifax and while there did not know of the possibility of making a refugee claim based on gender violence. With respect to current fear, the claimant testified that the man she fears has continued to ask about her. He told her cousin recently that he expects the claimant to return to him. While the panel cannot be certain, of course, whether this claimant will be persecuted by her former spouse should she return to Saint Lucia, the threshold for refugee protection is not certainty or probability but more than a mere possibility.\nWith respect to state protection, the claimant provided testimony with regard to several attempts she made to get protection from the police. The documentary evidence indicates that violence against women continues to be a serious problem in Saint Lucia.\nThe evidence indicates that there are legal avenues open to women to seek protection but the application of these laws is inconsistent. The provision of legal aid, shelters and counseling to women were all \"under discussion\" according to the documentary evidence before me but do not appear to be in a viable form. The one legal aid clinic that would assist women was forced to close because of a lack of financial support. There is a lack of information in the documentary evidence to indicate whether the police adequately step-in and offer protection to abused women.3 The claimant's evidence is, that from her experience, they do not. Subsequent to the hearing, more current information has come to my attention. It is in the form of a Response to Information Request prepared by the documentation department of this Board. In this information request, the past president of the Crisis Centre in Saint Lucia states that most complaints of domestic violence received by the police are not taken seriously. She states that while the problem of sexual violence is widespread, few cases make it to the courts and that the sentences for the perpetrators are often lenient. The other statements she makes regarding police attitudes are consistent with the claimant's testimony regarding her experiences. A gender relations officer, who works for a government Ministry, states that there has been recently a positive shift in the attitude of the police towards domestic violence but a clear indication that the police respond effectively and consistently is not indicated. The manager of the Women's Support Centre indicates that although some assistance is now provided to women some of her clients have stated that their complaints were ignored and were met with \"unprofessionalism\". This last statement is not explained. It appears that the Family Court now will respond with a protection order, it is not clear what would happen in a situation such as the claimant where she does not live with the abuser and would rely on the police to come to her aid. The response ends with a statement that indicates violence against women continues to be a serious problem in Saint Lucia and that a rally was held in XXXXX 2003 to protest against the lack of progress in an investigation of a rape and murder of a young girl.4\nI find that the documentary evidence supports the claimant's testimony that adequate state protection in Saint Lucia was not forthcoming when she sought it and that it would not be forthcoming were she to return to Saint Lucia at this time.\nThe claimant has established that there is a reasonable chance she would face persecution were she to return to Saint Lucia.\nThe Refugee Protection Division determines that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is a Convention refugee.\n\"Fay Sims\"\nFay Sims\nDATED at Toronto this 9th day of May 2003.\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - WOMEN REFUGEES - GENDER - DOMESTIC VIOLENCE - PARTICULAR SOCIAL GROUP - GENDER-RELATED PERSECUTION - STATE PROTECTION - FEMALE - POSITIVE - SAINT LUCIA\n1 Exhibit M-1.\n2 Exhibit C-1.\n3 Exhibit R-1, item 7, Response to Information Request, LCA31193.E, February 5,1999.\n4 Response to Information Request, LCA41520.E, April 25, 2003.\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n4\nTA2-02714\nTA2-02714\n",

The hearing for this claim was held pursuant to section 170(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act1 (IRPA) on January 3, 2003 at Toronto, Ontario.\nThe claimant's identity is established through his passport and his Portuguese identity card, both of which, he presented at the hearing and copies of both are now included in the documentary evidence.2\nThe claimant clearly stated that he does not fear persecution, or any other serious harm in Portugal. He stated in an honest and straightforward manner that he came to Canada because he preferred to live here rather than in Portugal. He also stated that he preferred Canada to any of the other European countries to which he could go and live, because of his membership in the European Economic Community.\nHe explained that he preferred Canada because of the work opportunities here and also because his brother lives in Canada.\nThe claimant does not fear persecution or any other serious harm as defined in sections 96, 97(1)(a), and 97(1)(b) of the Act, should he return to Portugal or go to any of the countries in the European Economic Community, in which he has a right to reside.\nThe Refugee Protection Division determines that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is neither a Convention Refugee nor a person in need of protection.

The hearing for this claim was held pursuant to section 170(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act1 (IRPA) on March 7, 2003, at Toronto, Ontario.\nThe claimant is alleging the need for refugee protection because she is a victim of domestic violence, which gives her claim a nexus to a Convention ground. I have taken the Gender Guidelines2 into consideration before rendering a decision in this claim.\nIn order to be determined to be a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, the evidence must establish that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution for a Convention ground or must establish that her removal to her country of nationality would subject her personally (a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or (b) to a risk to her life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nThe claimant testified that she got involved with a XXXXXXXX at the end of 1997. She lived with him on and off, as he was from another town, and he supported her family financially about four or five months into their relationship. He became physically and verbally abusive after six months. The family returned the gifts, which he had given to them and she moved her possessions out of his home by the end of 1998. He started stalking and threatening her. Fearing for her life she left the country and came to Canada in XXXXX 1999. She asked for refugee protection two years later, in February 2002.\nAnalysis:\nIdentity:\nThe claimant's original passport was before me therefore I accepted her identity and nationality.\nCredibility:\nI will assign the benefit of doubt to the claimant's allegations of domestic violence for the period of about six months in 1998. Her testimony was uncontradicted and without apparent embellishment. Her allegations are plausible, as violence against women, particularly domestic violence, remains a serious problem in St. Vincent.3 However, I find that the long delay in claiming for protection undermines the credibility of her testimony, that she left St. Vincent and cannot return because XXXXXXXX is still threatening her. I find that her allegation, that adequate state protection is not available for somebody in her predicament, is not supported by the documentation before me.\nDelay:\nDelay in making a claim has been recognized by the Federal Court as an important factor in assessing its validity,4 it is not a decisive factor,5 however, it is reasonable to expect that those with a well-founded fear of persecution will attempt to apply for Convention refugee status without unreasonable delay.6 This was not done here. The claimant declared that she fled her country because Mr. XXXXX was stalking and threatening her and her family. She testified that he continued to harass her by telephone after she arrived in Canada, and that he is continuing to threaten her family, however, she did not ask for protection until February 2002, two years after she arrived. She stated that she did not know what to do until a friend told her about counsel on record. She then consulted with him and filed her claim immediately. I find that just stating that she did not know what to do for two years, is not sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to ignore the delay, there must be more. The claimant was given many opportunities to explain about her efforts to protect herself, from being forced to return to St. Vincent, keeping in mind that Mr. XXXXX allegedly threatened her also in Canada. Nothing else was forthcoming. I find that the delay undermines the credibility of continuous threats by Mr. XXXXX.\nState Protection:\nI find that the claimant's allegations that adequate state protection7 is not available in St. Vincent for a woman, who finds herself in her predicament is not supported by the documentation before me.\nThe claimant stated that she complained to the police twice in 1998 after Mr. XXXXX assaulted her in XXXXX 1998, to no avail. I find that these two instances where her complaint was not taken seriously by police, is not clear and convincing evidence required to rebut the presumption of a state's ability to protect, keeping in mind that the burden of proof8 is higher in a multiparty, parliamentary democracy, such as St. Vincent. Even though the claimant's complaints might not have been taken seriously in 1998, because she did not know her rights and might have easily been intimidated, she indicated that she has become more assertive since living in Canada and would contact help as described in the following reports in order to protect herself.\nThis issue of state protection is addressed by:\nThe Country Reports on Human Rights Practises - 2001 for St. Vincent and the Grenadines, which states that:\nViolence against women, particularly domestic violence, remains a serious problem. The Domestic Violence\/Matrimonial Proceedings Act and the more accessible Domestic Violence Summary Proceedings Act provide for protective orders, as well as occupation and tenancy orders; the former only is accessible through the High Court, but the latter can be obtained without the services of a lawyer in family court. As part of a human rights education program, the SVGHRA conducts numerous seminars and workshops throughout the country to familiarize citizens with their rights. Increasing numbers of women are coming forward with domestic violence complaints ...\nAnd continues that\nThe Ministry of Education, Women's Affairs, and Culture has a women's desk that assists the National Council of Women with seminars, training programs, and public relations. The minimum wage law specifies that women should receive equal pay for equal work.\nMarion House, a social services agency established by the Catholic Church in 1989 and staffed by four trained counselors and three foreign volunteers, provides counseling and therapy services. During the year, the organization was relocated to government-built facilities, following a fire that destroyed the previous building.\nA Response to Information Request9 addresses the implementation of the 1995 Domestic Violence Act; namely,\nDuring a 14 May 1999 telephone interview with the Coordinator of the Saint Vincent and Grenadines Human Rights Association it was stated that the Domestic Violence Acts (Domestic Violence and Matrimonial Proceedings Act of 1994 and Domestic Violence Summary Proceedings Act of 1995) were being \"implemented to the maximum\" and that protection orders were being utilized. However the Coordinator stated that women are reluctant to prosecute perpetrators of domestic violence for reasons of financial dependence and often prefer settlement out of court.\nThe Coordinator added that women who are victims of domestic violence go to the Social Welfare Department, the Women's Affairs Department or human rights organizations which provide them with counselling and advice. Victims may also register a complaint directly with the Family Court where they are given a court date. All of these institutions are situated in Kingstown. The Coordinator further added that all services are provided free of charge and that there are venues for legal aid if the victim wishes legal representation, or she may pay for a lawyer herself. The Coordinator added that there is no support system of homes of refuge for battered women nor any state-run support systems in terms of social benefits.\nA 14 May 1999 interview with the Coordinator of the Department of Women's Affairs stated that the Domestic Violence Act has given the family court full jurisdiction over matters of domestic violence. The court can serve protection orders which may entail physical removal from the home or forbidding telephone or work place contact of the perpetrator with the victim; they cover common law as well as marital relationships. The act gives police the power of arrest if perpetrators are in breach of orders from the court and makes provision for both victims and perpetrators to receive counselling if the president of the court deems this necessary.\nThe Coordinator added that from October to December of each year since 1995, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has emphasized issues of particular concern to women through an annual media information campaign. This campaign has specifically sought to address the needs of women inhabiting rural areas. Part of this campaign takes place in schools at all levels, from the elementary level onward, where discussion sessions are held and where laws and the mechanisms which have been put in place to fight against domestic violence are discussed. Part of these sessions pertain to the necessity to report and prosecute domestic violence offences.\nThe Coordinator added that based on discussions which have taken place during these sessions, flyers and leaflets are produced which attempt to bring to light an understanding of domestic violence in the framework of various conventions such as The Convention on the Rights of the Child. The coordinator also stated that a cartoon booklet entitled Belling the Cat has been published for children addressing the question of silencing victims of domestic violence, particularly those of incest and battery. As well, the Department of Women's Affairs organizes regular awareness-raising sessions for police officers and efforts have been made to assign at least one female police officer to each police station. The Coordinator also added that for the last quarter of 1998, three to four per cent of cases of domestic violence were supported by sufficient evidence to be brought to the high court.\nAccording to an Internet article posted by the International Women's Health Coalition, entitled \"CEDAW Meets in New York to Review Reports from 8 Countries,\" the Coordinator of the Saint Vincent and Grenadines Women's Bureau also represented the islands at the sixteenth and seventeenth sessions of the General Assembly of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) which took place in January 1997. A summary of the report presented at the assembly which refers to the implementation of the Domestic Violence Act indicates that a Family Court and legal aid have been introduced since inception of the act.\nThe CEDAW Committee blamed \"Pervasive traditional, social, and cultural values, as well as generally accepted behaviour patterns ...\" as factors and difficulties affecting the implementation of the Convention. (ibid., 22)\nA 14 May 1999 telephone interview with the Director of Marion House, a Kingstown social services agency which is cited in Country Reports 1998 states that changes in laws and the signing of conventions have made the public of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines more sensitive to the issue of domestic violence. However, the Director stated that the problem of ingrained attitudes persists and that those in authority, such as lawyers or police officers who are in a position to apply the law, maintain an attitude whereby matters of domestic violence are considered to be of concern to the family and as a result may not follow instituted procedures as they should.\nThe Director also mentioned that economic pressure is an element which deters women from prosecuting the offenders since men may be the family's sole source of income and their prosecution or incarceration may deprive the family of means. The Director corroborated that there is no shelter for battered women on Saint Vincent and that staff at Marion House may informally ask sympathetic persons to put up a victim. The Director added that \"the system itself will work for you, but the problem lies with ingrained attitudes which serve to hamper proper implementation of the law.\"\nAnother Response to Information Request10 comments on protection available for women who are being stalked by a former partner, as alleged by the claimant. The report states that:\nThe country has no specific sexual harassment and\/or stalking laws. These crimes and their penalties are covered under Act 23\/88 of the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Criminal Code. In cases where women are being stalked or harassed by former spouses or boyfriends, victims may make a complaint to the Family Court and seek protection orders there. For women who are stalked or harassed by strangers, complaints may be made to the High Court where a judge will rule on what protection measure are needed for the victim depending on the respective circumstances of the case. According to the coordinator, legal recourse to the courts is available and the judicial system effectively contributes to the implementation of protection measures.\nThe issue of stalking has not come to light in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and the SVGHRA has not received any complaints of stalking in its 13 year existence, nor has it heard of any through media reports.\nOther documents in our RPD Information Package are outdated and refer to the situation of women before 1997. Counsel's IWRAW Publication,11 which is undated, also shows that the research for its conclusions was completed between 1990 - 1996.12 I find that the above quoted documents indicate that governmental and societal attitudes have slowly been changing in the past six years and that adequate protection is available for a woman who needs protection. It is also noted that refugee claims are not meant to permit an applicant the opportunity to seek better protection abroad than she would receive at home.13\nConclusion:\nAs there is state protection available for somebody who finds herself in the claimant's predicament, I find that this claim has to fail. Having considered the totality of the evidence, the relevant statutory provisions and jurisprudence, the Refugee Protection Division rejects the claim of XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. She is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\n\"Elke Homsi\"\nElke Homsi\nDATED at Toronto this 12th day of March 2003.\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - WOMEN REFUGEES - GENDER - PARTICULAR SOCIAL GROUP - GENDER-RELATED PERSECUTION - DOMESTIC VIOLENCE - STATE PROTECTION - CREDIBILITY - DELAY - FEMALE - NEGATIVE - SAINT VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution: Guidelines Issued by the Chairperson Pursuant to Section 65(3) of the Immigration Act, IRB, Ottawa, March 9, 1993, Update: November 1996, as continued in effect by the Chairperson on June 28, 2002 pursuant to section 159(1)(h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n3 Exhibit R-1, RPD Information Package, item 4, United States Department of State, Country Reports on Human Rights Paractises for 2001, Section 5, \"Women\".\n4 Heer, Karnail Singh v.

I have taken the Gender Guidelines2 into consideration before rendering a decision in these claims.\nIn order to be determined to be a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, the evidence must establish that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution for a Convention ground or must establish that their removal to their country of nationality would subject them personally either (a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or (b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nIDENTITY\nHaving examined the claimants' passports at the hearing, I accept the personal identities of the claimants and that they are citizens of St. Lucia.\nISSUES AND DETERMINATION\nThe determinative issue in these claims is whether adequate state protection is available for women who fear domestic abuse in St. Lucia.\nHaving considered the totality of the evidence, both oral and documentary,3 and the submissions of counsel, the panel finds that the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of refugee protection.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant alleges a fear of XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. He had been her common-law partner from 1993 to XXXXX 1999, when she told him to leave her house, where the claimant and XXXXX had cohabited with her five children from prior relationships. She testified that the relationship was problematic after XXXXX 1999 because of insults and aggressive behaviour directed at her and her children, particularly her co-claimant.\nIn XXXXX 1999 the claimant was violently attacked by XXXXX and she reported the matter to the police who filed assault charges against him. In XXXXX 2000, XXXXX returned but the claimant was able to defend herself and rebuffed his attack and forced him out of the house. This incident was also reported to the police and two officers escorted her home where they searched the premises for XXXXXX before leaving the claimant there.\nThe claimant sought assistance from the St. Lucia Crisis Centre Project Committee and they provided a detailed report of her problems4 and instructed her about applying to Family Court for a protection order. The claimant's application5 was made on XXXX X, 2000 but the order was never granted because the court required the attendance of XXXXXXX, as well as the claimant.\nThe claimant also provided a letter from the police in XXXXXX6 that states there were assault charges pending in court and several other complaints filed by the claimant against XXXXXX. This police report states that the claimant left St. Lucia before resolution of the case.\nANALYSIS\nState protection, even though not perfect,7 is available in St. Lucia for a woman who is subjected to domestic violence.8 The police provided evidence to verify that they had recorded the complaints of the claimant, and filed assault charges. Further, she was escorted home after her XXXXX 2000 report to the police and when threatened in XXXXX 2001, she was provided temporary sanctuary in the police station and asked to provide a description of XXXXX to the lone officer on duty. The police letter from the XXXXXX Police Station, XXXXX X, 20029 describes the particulars of the claimant's reports to the authorities, states that assault charges were filed against XXXXX on XXXXXX, 1999 and that police had investigated this incident. There is a XXXXXX, 2000 document that is a referral from the St. Lucia Crisis Centre Project Committee to the Family Court supporting the claimant's application for a protection Order.\nThis claimant did make efforts to seek protection in St. Lucia and it is the finding of this panel that the state did offer protection to her. The protection was not perfect but it is found to be available and adequate. The police provided records of their reports, assault charges were laid, and the crisis agency was supporting the claimant.\nThe panel finds that the claims fail because the claimant has failed to show that the state did not make serious attempts to provide available and adequate state protection for them. The protection provided need not be perfect; however, I find that the police did take reports, investigated, laid charges and provided her sanctuary in their station in XXXXX 2001 and escorted her home and searched the premises in XXXXX and I find that state protection is available and adequate.\nThe claimant has provided evidence that she has a subjective fear that continues to be problematic in Canada, but I find that there is no objective basis for her fear that is not resolved by adequate state protection.\nCONSOLIDATED GROUNDS\nAs I find that there is adequate state protection available, the claims must also fail on the grounds of a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture.\nTherefore, the Refugee Protection Division rejects the claims of XXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXX for refugee protection and determines them neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n\"M.

He claims to have a well-founded fear of persecution in Mexico based on the Convention ground of his membership in a particular social group, namely homosexual male. In addition he claims to be a person in need of protection as a person at risk of losing his life or being subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Mexico.\nCounsel sent under cover of letters dated April XXX, 2003, two packages of documents to be included in materials at the hearing. The packages were received at the Refugee Protection Division on Friday, April 25, 2003. Given the intervening week-end, the panel received one package on Monday, April 28, and the second only on the morning of the hearing. One of the packages was approximately two inches thick. Given RPD Rule 29 (4) that clearly indicates that disclosure of documents for a hearing must be made no later than 20 days prior to a hearing, counsel was asked to explain the very late disclosure of these documents.\nCounsel said that he had assumed that he had disclosed the bulkier package of materials on January 28, 2003 when he and the claimant appeared at a hearing to show cause why the claim should not be declared abandoned. He said that only when two relatively new documents had come to his attention and he was planning to disclose those did he discover that he had not disclosed his basic package - the bulky one. He further explained that he had been XXXX in December and that work had backed up at his offices and that as of early-March he XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXX.\nThe panel has discretion to waive the 20-day disclosure rule. In exercising its discretion it is suggested that the panel be guided by the relevance and probative value of the documents, any new evidence it brings to the hearing and whether the party, with reasonable effort could have provided the document as required by Rule 29.\nThe hearing of this claim had been first set for January 6, 2003. The Notice to Attend that hearing was sent to counsel as early as August 28, 2002. Counsel described the bulky package as his basic package on Mexico. It contains items dating as far back as the mid 1990s. The panel while sympathetic with counsel's XXXXX and office situation does not find these matters and his \"assumption\" to be a satisfactory explanation for the delay in disclosing such old documents. The panel declined to accept the bulky basic package. Regarding the slimmer package, some of the items therein date back to 2001. Two of the 2002 documents speak of the situation in areas of Mexico other than the province in which the claimant lived. The panel declined to accept the older documents in that package and accepted only the two that were published in late January 2003.\nThe panel adopted the same reasoning with regards to documents disclosed by the RPO to counsel by letter of April XXX, 2003. The RPO had been absent from work for more than a month but given the dates of the items in her late disclosure package, all items except one had been available to her at the time she made an earlier disclosure to counsel and the panel in October 2002. The exceptional item was the U.S.A. Department of State Report on Human Rights Practices in Mexico in 2002 that had not become available until the end of March 2003. Counsel agreed to the acceptance of that document into evidence at the hearing.\nCounsel then produced a further three documents: two medical documents and an employment letter for the claimant. These documents had been requested through a Screening Form sent to counsel and claimant in 2002. The claimant explained that he had had problems obtaining the documents from Mexico. Given the nature and high probative value of these documents, given that the panel had time to read through the scant three pages, given their relevance to the claim these documents were admitted.\nAllegations1\nThe claimant realized that he was attracted to men from an early age and was harassed at school because of his effeminacy. As an adult he lived in XXXXXX. In 1991 police raided a private party attended by the claimant and took money and jewellery away from those present. The claimant worked as a teacher at two schools and lost both jobs because of his \"immoral\" or \"improper\" behaviour. After that he worked at the XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX. He was excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church because of his homosexuality. In XXXX 1998 while in a park with a friend, XXXX, four men attacked both the claimant and XXX and hurt the claimant with a knife so that he needed medical attention. In XXXX 2001, while again in a park with XXXXX a policeman insulted the claimant and XXXXX, beat the claimant and demanded money from him. Again the claimant required medical attention.\nThe claimant went to the police station the following day to complain of the policeman's behaviour. The police there did not believe the claimant and told him that police do not behave in that manner. The following day while on the road the same policeman, XXXXXXXX, forced the claimant into a car, told the claimant that he hated faggots, and demanded the payment of 600 pesos within two days threatening that should the money not be forthcoming the claimant would be a dead faggot.\nThe claimant received the money from XXXXXX. The following day as the claimant was leaving work he saw XXXXX across the street from him. He ran to XXXX and remained there in hiding until he could organize the funds to get a passport and travel. He left Mexico on XXXXXX, 2001, arriving in Canada that day. He claimed Convention refugee status in December 2001.\nDetermination\nThe panel finds that the claimant is not a Convention refugee as he does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in Mexico. The panel also finds that the claimant is not a person in need of protection in that there is not a reasonable chance that his life would be at risk or that he would face cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Mexico. No credible evidence was adduced to lead the panel to find that the claimant is a person in need of protection in that there exist substantial grounds to believe that he will be subjected to a danger of torture.\nAnalysis\nThe panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is a citizen of Mexico. This finding is based on copies of pages of his passport provided by Canada Immigration who do not indicate that they regard the document as fraudulent.2\nThe panel will detail below why it does not find that it has credible3 evidence before it to allow it to accept the claim.\nAt the hearing the claimant said that he feared the police in Mexico and also feared his own family. Regarding the police his Personal Information Form (PIF)4 describes an event that allegedly took place in XXXXX 1998.\nXXXXX and I went to a park called XXXXXXXX. The park is a hangout for gay men. At about 9 p.m., we were attacked by a group of 4 men who started by swearing at us. They beat us. I was attacked by a knife and had to seek medical attention.\n(the panel's emphasis)\nA document from Dr. XXXXXXXXX from XXXXXX, dated XXXXX, 19985 states that the claimant received medical attention for bruises, scratches and severe contusions, and that in addition the claimant, \"showed a 12 cm injury caused, it seems, by a cutting device, which required suture - 8 stitches.\"\nThe PIF narrative also describes an event that occurred allegedly in XXXX 2001.\nI was with XXXXX in a park in the XXXXX at around 8 p.m. We were joking and having a nice time. We were approached by a policeman who started to interrogate us calling us faggots and other names. We did not respond to his provocation. Then he demanded money. I told him I would not give him any. He started to beat me with his baton.\nAs a result of the beating, I felt dizzy and disoriented. XXXXXX took me to a hospital for treatment.\nAfter this incident, I was so upset, that the next day, I went to the police station in XXXX XXXXX to complain.\n(the panel's emphasis)\nIn Exhibit C-3, there is a letter from the same doctor mentioned earlier dated XXXXX, 2001. This describes the physical state of the claimant at that time as exhibiting severe contusion on the cranium, bruises on the torso legs and arms, scratches, a swollen elbow and blurred vision and confusion.\nThe claimant's testimony at the hearing was not consistent with the details mentioned above. He said that he received the knife injury that required stitches at a small park, the XXXX park. When asked what the XXXX Park was he insisted that he received the knife injury at the XXXX park and said he never got a knife wound in XXXX Park. He said that he received this injury in XXXXXX 2001, something he reiterated three times. He also testified to receiving the knife wound just before coming to Canada. When the relevant portion of his PIF narrative was read to him the claimant said he had made a mistake. Asked whether the mistake was in his PIF or his testimony the claimant said the error was in his PIF.\nCounsel asked the claimant to tell of the incident in XXXX 2001. He testified that he was sitting in the park with XXXXX when a group of police arrived. The police shouted insults, called them faggots and one of the policemen pulled him by the hair and started to beat him. He said that because police usually have their names on their clothing he realized that the police beating him was XXXXX. He said there were four other policemen with XXXXX. Asked who stabbed him, he said it was XXXXX.\nThe claimant was asked to comment and explain the many discrepancies of time, place, attacker(s). He said first of all that he had learned two weeks before the hearing of the death in a car accident of a girl friend - XXXXXX. He would testify later that she had been a colleague at school, that he had met her in 1997, had kept in touch, once in a while and had not shared a social life with her. Still later he explained the discrepancies by saying that the incidents were very similar and had both been traumatic so he had mixed them up.\nIt would be only after a fifteen minutes break in the hearing that the claimant would return and testify that he did not recognize the people who attacked him in 1998, that they were wearing civilian ordinary clothes, that they could have been people who lived in the neighbourhood and that it occurred in XXXXX park. He would also later testify that it was XXXXX who approached and interacted with the claimant and XXXXX in the park in XXXX 2001.\nThe panel does not find the claimant's explanation satisfactory. Both attacks allegedly took place in parks, in both the claimant was allegedly with XXXX, and after both incidents the claimant allegedly needed medical attention. However the panel finds the differences to be far greater than the similarities. In the PIF and in his last recounting of the 1998 incident it was not the police who attacked. More significantly, it was not XXXX who slashed him with a knife. Given his testimony that XXXX would later force him into a car, would force him to perform oral sex, would demand money from him, the panel does not find credible that he could be confused as to the assailant who allegedly knifed him. According to the PIF and to the claimant's last recounting of incidents four police and XXXXX were not involved in any park incident, whether in 1998 or 2001. The panel also does not find credible that the claimant could testify that he received the knife wound just before he came to Canada, and that was in XXXXX 2001, if indeed the knife wound had been received two years earlier in 1998.\nThe claimant's recounting of events following the alleged XXXX 2001 event were also not free from inconsistencies. In his PIF there is no information about the claimant delivering a payment of 600 pesos or any amount to XXXX. Rather the PIF narrative states that the claimant saw XXXXX across the street as the claimant was leaving work the day after XXXXX had allegedly pulled him into a dark car and demanded the money. In the narrative when the claimant saw XXXXX he ran to XXXXX home and hid there, stopped going to work, and remained there until he could get together sufficient funds to obtain a passport and leave the country.\nAt the hearing the claimant testified that he saw XXXXX across the street about a week after the car incident. He said he took the bus for the twenty-minutes drive to XXXXXX, got the money from XXXX, returned on a bus to XXXXX and handed over the 600 pesos. He said that he had not gone to work during the week between the car incident and handing over the money, and had only gone to work the day of the hand-over because he had a report to hand in. He testified that when he handed over the funds to XXXXX, the policeman had told him that there would be more demands for money.\nAsked why there is no mention of the handing over of funds to XXXXX, the claimant said he must have forgotten. The other inconsistencies as to timing were not pointed out to the claimant. The panel does not find credible that the claimant would have forgotten to put into his PIF his alleged subsequent handing over of funds to XXXXX. Allegedly it was at the handing over that XXXXX made it clear that there would be more demands made to him.\nThere is no mention in the PIF of the claimant having been forced to perform oral sex on XXXXX. He explained the absence by saying he might have forgotten. The panel finds this bit of testimony to be exaggeration to embellish his story.\nThe panel finds that the allegations around events in parks in XXXXXXX in 1998 and 2001 were concocted for the claim and that the medical documents produced at the hearing are not genuine or authentic documents. The panel finds not credible the claimant's evidence of matters following from those alleged two attacks. The claimant's evidence around telephone calls to his home was inconsistent. Further, the claimant was unable to explain why he should feel that persons calling his residence and asking for him was a threatening or frightening matter. The panel finds that it lacks credible evidence on which to find that there is a reasonable chance that the claimant would face persecution from the police should he return to Mexico and his hometown XXXXXXX. The panel comes to a similar finding regarding the refugee protection ground of risk to life or to cruel and unusual treatment at the hands of members of the Mexican police.\nThe claimant's homosexual partner XXXXX continued living in that city. According to the claimant he knows of no problems faced by XXXXX with the police except in the incidents that the panel has already found not credible. He stated that the only problem he knows of XXXXX facing is that when they last spoke in September of 2002 he learned that XXXXX had tested HIV positive. XXXXX allegedly held down two jobs, one as a XXXXX XXXXX the other as a XXXXX.\nRegarding the claimant's alleged fear of his family. He said that when he came home late his brother would question him and beat him. He said he beat the brother back. The claimant is not a child. He is an adult of 30. The panel cannot find that he needs to share accommodation with a bullying brother. The panel finds it lacks credible evidence on which to find that there is a reasonable chance that the claimant would face persecutory treatment from his family should he return to Mexico. The panel also finds that it lacks credible evidence on which to base a positive finding on the refugee protection ground of risk to life or to cruel and unusual treatment at the hands of members of his family.\nThe panel finds the claimant's testimony regarding his alleged excommunication from the church to be not credible. The claimant testified that he met with a priest, XXXXX XXXXX, that he told this priest that he did not wish to have children. He said that XXXXXX then told him that if he didn't change his ways he would be excommunicated. The claimant was then asked what happened subsequently and his reply was that he never went back to church. When he was reminded that in his narrative he states that he was subsequently excommunicated, the claimant then told of attending a luncheon at his father's home at which XXXXXX was present. He said that XXXXX Xtook him aside and told him that he was excommunicated. He said he received nothing in writing to that effect. The panel finds it implausible that a priest delivers the Roman Catholic Church's final break with a member over a casual chat at a luncheon. The claimant at the hearing failed to mention the excommunication when asked what happened after his conversation with XXXXX until he was prompted regarding the statement in his PIF. His failure to mention this until prompted leads the panel to find that it is improbable that the excommunication occurred.\nThe panel finds that it lacks credible evidence that there is a reasonable chance that the claimant would face persecutory treatment from his church should he return to Mexico. The panel similarly finds that there is not a reasonable chance that the claimant would face a risk to his life or to cruel and unusual treatment from the Roman Catholic Church in Mexico.\nNothing in the panel's findings above should be read as indicating its belief that it is not possible for a homosexual male to face persecutory treatment in Mexico. The panel is aware of the reluctance of many Mexicans to have close relations with homosexual persons. The panel is aware that there are situations in Mexico in which Mexican homosexuals, male or female, could face behaviour from police or others that could be deemed persecutory. What the panel has to deal with here however, is the particulars of this claim, and we find these particulars to be not credible.\nAccordingly the panel finds that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection in that there is a reasonable chance that he would face a risk to his life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment should he return to Mexico. We have already found that no credible evidence was adduced to lead us to find that the\nclaimant is a person in need of protection in that there exists substantial grounds to believe that he will be subjected to torture.\nAccordingly, the panel rejects this claim.\n\"Hope Sealy\"\nHope Sealy\nDATED at Toronto this 9th day of May 2003.\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - EVIDENCE - DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE - ADMISSIBILITY - DISCLOSURE - PRACTICE - PROCEDURE - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION RULES - PARTICULAR SOCIAL GROUP - HOMOSEXUALS - SEXUAL ORIENTATION - CREDIBILITY - MALE - NEGATIVE - MEXICO\n1 Exhibit C-1, Personal Information Form completed by the claimant - summary of.\n2 Exhibit M-1.\n3 Orelien v.

He alleges a well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of government agents by reason of his political opinion and his membership in a particular social group, namely members of the XXXXXX community.\nSummary of Personal Information Form1 (PIF) Allegations\nThe claimant alleges that, as part of a group organizing and staging demonstrations to protest government and oil company degradation of land without recompense to the XXXXXXX community, he and fellow group members were harassed and tortured by Nigerian police. He alleges that he was arrested on XXXXXXX 2002 and released with the assistance of XXXXXX group members. After going to XXXXXXXX, where he bought a passport, he left Nigeria for Canada, arriving in this country on March 30, 2002.\nDetermination\nI find the claimant not to be a Convention Refugee because I do not believe his account of the events that led him to seek refugee protection and therefore he has not established a well-founded fear of persecution on a Convention ground in Nigeria.\nIn addition, I find that the claimant is not a person in need of protection in that his removal to Nigeria would not subject him personally to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel or unusual treatment or punishment, and in that there are no substantial grounds to believe that his removal to Nigeria will subject him personally to a danger of torture.\nAnalysis\nThe issues in this matter were identified at the outset of the hearing as credibility, personal, ethnic and political identity, the destruction of documents and the objective basis for a well-founded fear of persecution.\nIdentity\nThe claimant placed before me no documents supportive of his claimed Nigerian citizenship. Nevertheless, through a variety of questions put to him by counsel, the Refugee Protection Officer and by me, he demonstrated a detailed knowledge of that country sufficient to satisfy me that he was born, raised and educated in Nigeria. On that basis, I accept, on a balance of probabilities, that he is a citizen of Nigeria.\nHowever, I have only his word, which I have found to be not credible, that he is who he says he is; that he is XXXX and that he was involved politically as he claimed. Those elements of his identity are canvassed further below.\nCredibility\nCase law has established that a claimant's contradictory testimony can cast doubt upon the totality of his or her viva voce evidence. In Dan-Ash,2 Mr. Justice Hugessen stated:\nUnless one is prepared to postulate (and accept) unlimited credulity on the part of the Board, there must come a point at which a witness's contradictions will move even the most generous trier of fact to reject his evidence.\nIn my opinion, those words are applicable in this case.\nI found the claimant not to be a credible or trustworthy witness. In my opinion, his manner of testimony was neither candid nor straightforward. I found his evidence at times vague, internally inconsistent and not credible in areas key to his claim. As well, I found his evidence at times inconsistent with the documentary evidence.\nAccording to the claimant, he played a key role in an XXXXX group \"that organized and staged demonstration against the government of Nigeria and oil companies\"3 to protest the degradation of XXXX land and to fight for monetary compensation to the community from the oil profits of that land. Numerous internal inconsistencies, questions of plausibility and credibility lead me to doubt this, the matter at the heart of his claim.\nFor example, I found his initial statement that he participated in four such demonstrations to be internally inconsistent with his later testimony that he participated in only one. I also found internally inconsistent his early testimony that he was an organizer of the demonstrations with his later testimony that he was not actually an organizer, but organized by way of making financial contributions.\nI do not believe the claimant's story that from 1991 to 2002, he was one of about 25 members of the core group behind a loosely structured organization of indigenous XXXXX fighting the Nigerian government and oil companies in the oil fields. According to the claimant, this core group, the alleged backbone of the organization, consisted of militants who fought in the oil fields and who had the ear of the militant leaders, together with 5 of his fellow XXXX traders in the central market, the traders, including himself, all being funders of the organization. He testified that this group met weekly to discuss injuries sustained from police at the oil refineries where the demonstrations were staged, next actions and the funds needed to buy supplies for fighters for the upcoming week. First, I find it not credible that for eleven years the claimant attended weekly meetings of this core group but could name only two of the alleged militants in the field present at the meetings.\nSecond, I found vague the claimant's knowledge of other XXXX groups pursuing the same goals his allegedly did. He was asked what he knew of MOSOP.4 The claimant initially stated that he had never heard of MOSOP. He later stated that he was acquainted with Mr. Saro-Wiwa's XXXXX, while in XXXXX; had read of the government's accusations that Mr. Saro-Wiwa was responsible for the deaths of some XXXX chiefs and of his being put to death on those charges. Given the wide media coverage5 of MOSOP and the fact that MOSOP was still in the forefront in early 2002,6 I find it not plausible that a man purportedly interested and active in the same cause as MOSOP and allegedly discussing Kan Saro-Wiwa at his core group's weekly meetings would fail to recognize the acronym, MOSOP. In my opinion, the claimant's knowledge of MOSOP does not reflect a knowledge of the over-all situation that might reasonably be expected of a man meeting weekly for eleven years in pursuit of the same cause as MOSOP and still personally involved in the fight in XXXXXXX 2002.\nThird, the claimant alleged that he was a key member of a group active in armed demonstrations and willing to blow up oil rigs and to kidnap workers. He testified that, despite its ruthless crackdown on XXXX, none of his group had ever come to the attention of authorities of the military dictatorship of President Sani Abacha, in power from November 19937 to June 1998.8 That all 25 members of an XXXXXX group meeting weekly for such purposes could have escaped the notice of security forces of a repressive regime bent on ending XXXX actions9 over a period of some five years strains credulity, in my view. I do not believe the claimant.\nFourth, I find speculative the claimant's testimony that, in 2002, police may have learned of his activities from informants for bribed XXXXX chiefs. Moreover, I find his evidence in that regard to be internally inconsistent with his testimony that no one in his group had ever been suspected of being an informant and none had been exposed. I find not credible the reason given by the claimant for police interest in him in 2002.\nFifth, the claimant alleged that he went to only one of his organization's protest demonstrations and did so only 11 years after he first became involved. He gave no reason for waiting this long. I find not plausible his claim that, for a period of 11 years he provided weekly funding to sustain violent protests and attended weekly update meetings about them without checking the effectiveness of the protests first-hand at an earlier date.\nIn light of all of the above, I do not believe that the claimant was a core group member funding a nameless XXXX group's violent protest actions against environmental degradation of XXXX lands and its fight to gain recompense for the oil profits being earned on those lands.\nEven if I believed the claimant's account, which I do not, of his participation in a XXXXX 2002 demonstration at which he eluded the attention of security agents, I would find the described police actions in breaking up the demonstration not to be persecutory. According to the claimant, police began to arrive when armed protesters forcibly prevented workers from either entering or leaving an oil rig. He testified that police first shot tear gas into the group, later fired into a group of armed protesters and, while there were some injuries, there were no deaths. I would find rather that police used excessive force in dispersing unlawful trespassers. This incident allegedly occurred at an XXXXX rig in XXXX 2002. Given that the claimant maintained that only 50 or so protesters were present, I find the absence of documentary coverage of the alleged event not to be conclusive. Nevertheless, I have only the claimant's word, which I find not credible, that he was present at the alleged incident. I do not believe him.\nIn my opinion, an additional instance of the claimant's lack of credibility in an area central to his claim is his allegation that police imprisoned, tortured and accused him of being a core group member of an XXXX organization.\nFirst, I find his evidence of arrest and imprisonment to be contradictory to the documentary evidence.10 In the Record of his interview with an Immigration Officer \"No\" is ticked off as the answer to the question \"Have you ever been arrested or detained?\".11 The claimant explained that the answer was the result of miscommunication since he thought he was giving an answer to the previous question regarding whether he has ever committed, or been charged with or convicted of a crime or offense in any country. Yet, neither is mention made of his alleged arrest and imprisonment in the account recorded of his reasons for seeking refugee status and why he cannot return to his home country.12 The claimant insisted that he told the Immigration Officer of his arrest and imprisonment. Nevertheless, I find it not credible that, had the claimant done so, the Immigration Officer would have failed to note his alleged arrest and imprisonment in both of the two relevant areas of the Intake Form. The claimant is demonstrably fluent in the English language, testifying only in that language at the hearing. I do not believe his explanation for the contradiction between his own evidence and the documentary evidence regarding his alleged arrest and imprisonment.\nSecond, in his account of the reasons which led him to seek refugee protection and why he cannot return to his country,13 no mention is made of his having been tortured or of being accused of being a member of the core group he described. His explanation for this omission was that, because his interview was 3 days after his arrival in Canada, he knew he would be writing a PIF narrative and intended to include such details later. I find his explanation not credible. The claimant allegedly already had counsel. He has a relatively good education, having completed 12 years and achieving his General Certificate of Education, ('O'Level).14 He is observably an intelligent man. Yet, when asked by an official of the country in which he was seeking refugee protection why he was doing so, he chose to omit the very reasons on which he bases his claim. To my mind, in those circumstances, the claimant's failure to mention having been tortured by police is not reflective of actions that might reasonably be expected of a person allegedly fleeing his country in fear for his life. I find his explanation not credible. I have only the claimant's word, which I find not credible, that he was tortured by police or accused by them of being a member of an XXXX group. I do not believe his account.\nTo my mind, identity documents are central to the claim of this particular claimant since they could potentially establish his personal identity.15 Corroborative documentation that the claimant was raised and educated in XXXXXXX, Rivers State, and employed there in 2002, could potentially have lent support to his claim that that he is a member of the XXXXX tribe and that he resided near the locations of, and at the time of events in which he alleges he was involved.\nI found not reasonable his various explanations as to why no such documentation is before me. First, the claimant gave the absence of his mother and brother from XXX XXXXX as one of the reasons for the lack of identity documents. Thus, I find their whereabouts to be significant to his claim. However, his evidence regarding their whereabouts was internally inconsistent and his explanation for that inconsistency not credible, in my view. In his PIF, he lists both as being in XXXXXXX. Yet, his testimony was that his mother had returned to her home village ten years ago and his brother had moved to the Republic of Benin well before the claimant left Nigeria, allegedly on XXXXXX 2002.\nThe claimant's explanation was that their whereabouts listed in his PIF could have been a mistake. The claimant swore to the accuracy of the information in his PIF at the outset of the hearing. I find his evidence regarding the whereabouts of his mother and brother to be internally inconsistent and his explanation for that inconsistency not credible. In my view, his evidence in this, an area key to his claim, was not credible.\nSecond, I am not satisfied that the claimant made reasonable efforts to obtain documents supportive of his identity. He acknowledged that counsel stressed the importance of identity documents to his claim and that he knew the Immigration and Refugee Board had requested such documents. According to the claimant, at his request, his friend XXXXX searched his old home but failed to find identity documents. He testified variously that he did not ask XXXXXXX to get school documents because he did not know the telephone number of the school; because the school had moved and because it had closed down before he left Nigeria. Yet the claimant stated that he refused XXXXX offer to swear an affidavit confirming the claimant's identity because other refugee claimants told him that the Board would not accept such an affidavit. According to the claimant, he did not ask counsel's advice in that regard. I am not satisfied that the claimant made serious efforts to get supportive documentation of his identity. Moreover, I find that, without any identity documentation which he knew to be important, his admitted failure to check with counsel is not reflective of actions that might reasonably be expected of a person seeking Convention refugee status because he fears for his life in his home country. In my opinion, the claimant's various explanations for the absence of identity documents is yet another example of his lack of credibility before me.\nWell-founded fear of persecution\nThe documentary evidence reports that, despite efforts by the Nigerian government16 and of some XXXX leaders17 to restore peace to XXXXX, problems persist.18\nHowever, in my opinion, there is insufficient credible evidence before me to find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has established a well-founded fear of persecution in Nigeria on a Convention ground.\nI have found the claimant not to be a credible or trustworthy witness. Absent any supportive documentary evidence, I can make no finding as to who the claimant is or whether he is or is not of XXXX ethnicity.\nI do not believe that he was an XXXXXXX activist or that police arrested, imprisoned and tortured him because of his activism. I do not believe his account of the events that led to his claim.\nThe claimant destroyed the false passport under which he traveled; he made an inland claim and no plane tickets are before me. Thus, given my credibility findings, I do not know when the claimant left Nigeria; when he arrived in Canada or if he was present in Nigeria at the time of his alleged persecution. I have only the word of the claimant, whom I found not to be a credible witness, that Nigerian police continue to seek him.\nIn my opinion, there is before me insufficient credible evidence to conclude that there is more than a mere possibility of persecution were the claimant to return to Nigeria.\nI find XXXXX XXXXX XXX not to be a Convention refugee because I do not believe his account of the events that led him to seek refugee protection and therefore he has not established a well-founded fear of persecution on a Convention ground in Nigeria.\nIn addition, I find that the claimant is not a person in need of protection in that his removal to Nigeria would not subject him personally to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel or unusual treatment or punishment, and in that there are no substantial grounds to believe that his removal to Nigeria will subject him personally to a danger of torture.\nI reject his claim.\n\"S.E.

Her employer had scheduled her to go to Boston, Massachusetts on September 9, 2001 returning to California on September 11, 2001.1 She was to travel with American Airlines, returning on Flight #11. One week before this business trip, the claimant was let go from the company, so her trip was cancelled. As it has been well documented, the passengers of American Airlines Flight #11 became the victims of terrorist activity as the aircraft was used as a bomb to crash into the World Trade Center, New York City killing all passengers, crew and hundreds of others. The claimant was so frightened by this brush with death that on September XX, 2001, three days later, she put her suburban California home up for sale, accepting the offer to sell on September XX, 2001. The claimant then drove to Canada, entering at Windsor, Ontario on November 5, 2001. She made a claim to Convention refugee status on May 10, 2002.\nAnalysis and Findings\nThe panel finds that the claimant is not a Convention refugee, as she does not have a well-founded fear of persecution in the USA for a Convention reason. The panel also finds that the claimant is not a person in need of protection in that her removal to the USA would not subject her personally to a risk to life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. My reasons are as follows.\nThe claimant's identity as a national of the USA has been established by the testimony and the supporting documentation filed, namely, a certified copy of her American passport.2\nThe panel finds that the risk faced by the claimant stems from a generalized risk of terrorism which exists equally for every American citizen, and to varying degrees, for all countries. The claimant, therefore, does not have a well-founded fear of persecution in the USA for a Convention reason nor is she a person protected under section 97(1)(b)(ii) because protection is limited to those who face a specific risk not faced generally by others in the country. Although the claimant may experience her fear of terrorists more acutely given the fact that she came so close to being a passenger on that fateful flight, the fact remains that she is no more likely to be the victim of a terrorist act than any other American citizen.\nFurthermore, in Villafranca,3 the Court of Appeal, considering the claim of a Philippine policeman who feared a terrorist guerrilla group, suggested that protection need not be perfect:\nNo government that makes any claim to democratic values or protection of human rights can guarantee the protection of all of its citizens at all times...where a state is in effective control of its territory, has military, police and civil authority in place, and makes serious efforts to protect its citizens from terrorist activities, the mere fact that it is not always successful at doing so will not be enough to justify a claim that the victims of terrorism are unable to avail themselves of such protection.\nWith respect to the issue of compelling reasons, Counsel submitted that the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Centre constitutes a change in circumstances in the USA and therefore compelling reasons should be considered. The panel is not persuaded that the September 11, 2001 attack constitutes a change in circumstances, as this concept refers to a change that removes the objective basis for a claimant's fear. However, further analysis of this issue is not required. The panel finds that due to the generalized risk, nothing has changed - the claimant did not have a well-founded fear when she left the USA nor does she today.\nPrimarily, the panel finds that the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack on New York City is not in keeping with the meaning of a change in circumstances as intended by the legislators and the Courts. This term is used to denote an event, as a result of which, a claimant is no longer a refugee or person in need of protection. This presumes an improvement in country conditions, such as a regime change. The event in the case at hand has had the opposite effect, in that it has given rise to the claim. Even if one considered the terrorist attack to have created a \"change in circumstances\", the claimant would not have been found to be a Convention refugee or a person at risk to life at some time prior to this decision due to generalized risk. For these reasons, I cannot invoke compelling reasons.\nConclusion\nThe panel, therefore, finds that the claimant is not a Convention refugee and that she is not a person in need of protection pursuant to section 97(1)(b) of the IRPA. Also, there is no evidence that the claimant faces danger of torture as defined in s. 97(1)(a) of the IRPA.\nBased on the foregoing analysis, the Refugee Protection Division determines that the claimant, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n\"D.

He claims a well founded fear of persecution at the hands of the Sipah-e-Sahaba (SSP), an extremist Sunni organization, by reason of his membership in a particular social group - a mixed Sunni-Shia marriage.\nDetermination\nI find the claimant is a Convention refugee. My reasons for doing so follow below.\nAnalysis\nThe claimant was an exceptionally credible witness. His evidence was sincere and straightforward. He clearly differentiated between facts within his direct knowledge and information gleaned second hand or provided to him by his agent. He did not embellish.\nThe documentary evidence suggests that intermarriage can be cause for persecution in the context of an honour crime against the participants' families 1. This claimant's extended family was supportive of his marriage2. In this case the claimant's forceful rejection of a local Mulanah's intervention in his family affairs and children's education led to his targeting. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant's repudiation of the Mulanah's authority triggered his persecution. I find that the Mulanah and the SSP were both agents of persecution: the SSP acting as the enforcers of the Mulanah's animus toward the individual who defied him.\nAfter being attacked in XXXXXX 2002 the claimant was unable to obtain assistance from the police. This led the claimant to move his family to another city. He was attacked once more in XXXXXX 2002. Again the police did not assist him. He moved a second time. He was threatened in this location. At this point he decided that his wife and children should go into hiding and he would flee the country. The children were taken out of school and he came to Canada\nI am satisfied that the police characterized the claimant's complaints as domestic\/secular. As such, I accept that the documentary evidence is supportive of the claimant's testimony and that police protection was not reasonably forthcoming3.\nI further find that the evidence of the claimant's failed attempts to relocate to a place of safety demonstrates, on a balance of probabilities, that he faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout Pakistan.\nConclusion\nBased on the foregoing analysis I conclude that XXXXXXXXXXXXX is a Convention refugee.\nThe Refugee Protection Division therefore accepts his claim for protection.\n\"Margaret Leighton\"\nMargaret Leighton\nDATED at Toronto, Ontario, this 16th day of September, 2003.\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - PARTICULAR SOCIAL GROUP - MARRIAGE - STATE PROTECTION - MALE - POSITIVE - PAKISTAN\n1 Exhibit R-2.\n2 Exhibit C-3.\n3 Exhibit R-1.\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n3\nTA2-14581\nTA2-14581\n",

The hearing for this claim was held pursuant to section 170(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act1 (IRPA) on January 6, 2003 at Toronto, Ontario. At the conclusion of the hearing the panel rendered an oral negative decision. These are the written reasons which have been edited for syntax and grammar with added references to the documentary evidence and relevant case law where appropriate.\nThe claimant claims to fear persecution in Saint Vincent by reason of being a woman. She fears her former common-law husband.\nThe claimant's testimony of past persecution and past events going to the basis of her fear is contained in the narrative to her Personal Information Form,2 (PIF) and was expanded upon orally during the hearing.\nFor the purposes of these reasons I do not repeat all of that here. However, I have considered all of the claimant's testimony, all of the evidence before me, as well as the submissions of counsel. I have also considered, and am familiar with the Gender Guidelines.3\nI am satisfied that the claimant is a citizen of Saint Vincent, and that she is who she says she is based on the contents of Exhibit C-2, which contains her passport and another identity card identifying her as formerly employed as a police officer in Saint Vincent.\nI am also satisfied that the claimant's testimony is credible. There were a number of ostensible concerns. There was a long delay in claiming. There was also a contradiction, or an apparent contradiction, between the claimant's testimony and the port of entry notes as to the reason she made her claim. However, given her explanation, I am not drawing a negative inference from it. So, for these reasons, I am satisfied that the claimant is a credible witness.\nIn my view, the determinative issue for this claim is the issue of state protection. All states are presumed capable of protecting their citizens. Given the claimant's testimony and the documentary evidence before me, I am not persuaded that the claimant has rebutted that presumption. Again, I am not repeating all the evidence. However, the claimant admitted in testimony that the police in Saint Vincent, whom she has approached on a number of occasions, have never refused to act on her requests. It seems to me that the police action against her common law husband was curtailed in large measure by the claimant's unwillingness to pursue her complaints further. Apparently on one occasion in 1999, the claimant approached the police as a result of having been assaulted by her former common law husband, and the police arrested her former common law husband. However, the claimant did not pursue the matter in the courts.\nWhen asked why she was not willing to pursue the matter, the claimant explained that she had been acting as a surrogate mother to his children. She also explained that his children were young. However, when asked how old these children would be if she returned to Saint Vincent now, the claimant testified that the youngest of them would be 16 years of age. When pressed further as to why she would not be willing to pursue complaints against her former common law husband if she went back to Saint Vincent now, the claimant testified that she would not do so because she is a Christian.\nAccording to the documentary4 evidence, Saint Vincent,\n\"... has no specific sexual harassment and\/or stalking laws. These crimes and their penalties are covered under Act 23\/88 of the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Criminal Code. In cases where women are being stalked or harassed by former spouses or boyfriends, victims may make a complaint to the Family Court and seek protection orders there. For women who are stalked or harassed by strangers, complaints may be made to the High Court where a judge will rule on what protection measure are needed for the victim depending on the respective circumstances of the case ... legal recourse to the courts is available and the judicial system effectively contributes to the implementation of protection measures.\"\nI acknowledge counsel's submission which points out a previous Information Request,5 which notes that there is a problem of ingrained attitudes, and that lawyers and police maintain an attitude, where matters of domestic violence are concerned, that these are matters of concern to the family and as a result may not follow instituted procedures as they should. However, given the previous documentary evidence quoted and the claimant's testimony which suggests, in my view, that the police have never refused protection to the claimant and have taken action as requested by the claimant in the past, and which also suggests that recourse is available to women in the claimant's situation in the courts, I am not persuaded that there is clear and convincing evidence that the Saint Vincent state would not be reasonably forthcoming with protection, and would not make a serious effort at protecting the claimant if she were to return to Saint Vincent and request protection. I am aware of the claimant's testimony that she would not pursue that protection because she is a Christian. However, in my view, that is not a reasonable explanation for failing to ask for it. So, for all these reasons, I am not persuaded that state protection would not be available to the claimant if she were to return to Saint Vincent.\nFor all these reasons, I find that the claimant is not a Convention Refugee within the meaning of section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and that she is not a person in need of protection within the meaning of section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nFor all these reasons, I reject the claim of XXXXXXXXXXXXXX to refugee protection.\n\"Joel A.

In addition, he claims to be a person in need of protection, as a person in danger of being tortured or at risk of losing his life or being subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Peru.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant alleges that:\n1. He and his family left Peru because of the threats to his life from agents of Fujimori, the former president of Peru.\n2. His father worked for XXXXXXXX as a chief of XXXXXXXX and as a chief of the program of XXXXXXXXX.\n3. He reported to Mr. XXXXXXXX who was the President of XXXXXXXX and he was in charge of the budget of the entire corporation.\n4. After the change of the presidency, the claimant received a citation from the new government asking him to provide declaration of misappropriation of funds from XXXXXXXX.\n5. Subsequent to the receipt of the citation, the claimant was threatened on two occasions to leave the country or be killed, and his sister was kidnapped and threatened too. She managed to escape from her kidnappers unharmed when the car she was forced into met with an accident.\n6. Fearing these threats, the entire family left Peru. His father and sister went to the USA; his mother-who is a permanent resident of Canada-and he fled to Canada.\nANALYSIS\nThe determinative issues in this claim are: nexus, agents of persecution, credibility, and state protection.\nIdentity\nThe identity of the claimant has been established to the satisfaction of the panel. In this respect, reference is made to the supporting documents, namely, a certified copy of the passport, claimant's identity card and his driver's license from Peru.\nNexus\nFujimori, the former President of Peru resigned on November 20, 2001. After Alejandro Toledo's inauguration as the new President of Peru on July 28, 2001, the congress set up 64 investigative commissions to launch investigations into the misdeeds of the Fujimori government and one of the misdeeds identified was the misappropriation of budgets.\nThe documentary evidence1 indicates that the claimant's father was employed by the XXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXX XXXXXX (XXXXXXXX), a decentralised organisation of the Presidential Ministry, for over a year. His services to XXXXXXXX included being the Chief of XXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXX. The claimant's testimony concurs with the documentary evidence2 that the President of XXXXXXXX was XXXXXXXXX. The claimant testified that his father reported to XXXXXXXX who managed the budget of the Corporation. The claimant further indicated that XXXXXXXX was a close acquaintance of Fujimori. XXXXXXXX had complete control over the permits to make expenditures related to the Corporation, including expenditures from his father's department budget, provided these permits had his father's signature. After the change of the presidency, a commission was set by the new government to investigate the misappropriation of the budgets and one of the persons to be asked to make a declaration was the claimant's father. Many of the expenditures were never brought to his father's attention; therefore, when the investigations into the misappropriation of funds began, the father realised that his signatures were forged. Upon his father's receipt of the first citation from the commission, the claimant's family started receiving death threats from members loyal to the former government of Fujimori for fear of being investigated and possibly prosecuted.\nAs per Ward,3 political opinion is any opinion on which the machinery of the State is engaged. In this case, people loyal to Fujimori form an opposition to the present government and, therefore, are an anti-government entity and, therefore, a component of the \"state machinery\".\nBased on the above reasons, on a balance of probabilities, the panel finds that the claimant's father's evidence, in regards to the misappropriation of funds by XXXXXXXX from his department, is interpreted to be an imputed political opinion against the former government of Fujimori. The panel finds, in this case, that a political opinion was imputed to the claimant's father and, therefore, the claimant has established a nexus to the Convention refugee definition.\nCredibility\nThe panel finds the claimant to be a credible witness. His testimony was generally straightforward and trustworthy. He never tried to embellish his story to gain advantage in support of his claim. The panel, therefore, believes his allegations in support of his claim.\nHis evidence, generally, agreed with the documentary evidence entered as exhibits during the hearing. For example, he testified that XXXXXXXX was appointed as the head of the XXXXXXXX, and he was charged for misappropriation of funds in XXXXXXXX which concurs with the documentary evidence.4\nFurthermore, the claimant's demeanour during the hearing indicated his fear and frustrations as he narrated how his assailants had threatened to kill him if he did not leave Peru like his sister and father had. The claimant, in his testimony, and the counsel, in his submissions, explained to the panel's satisfaction some minor inconsistencies and implausibilities in his evidence.\nAgents of Persecution\nThe agents of persecution in this case are individuals who were involved in corruption in the government of Fujimori. They are motivated to harm the claimant's family because the claimant's father had received a citation from the government to make declarations against some members of the Fujimori government. His father's declaration would expose XXXXXXXX and several other corrupt members of the Fujimori regime.\nThe documentary evidence indicates that:\nThe targets of investigations into the misdeeds of the Fujimori era have long been complaining that they are victims of 'witch hunt' and 'political persecution'. For almost as long, this has been dismissed as the most obvious line of defence of people who would like to see it all go away. 5\nThe panel finds that the agents of persecution in this case were individuals involved in corruption during the Fujimori government. They are motivated to drive the claimant and his family out of Peru because of the knowledge the claimant's father has about their involvement in corruption. The citation he had received from the present government would enable him to denounce their corruption.\nState Protection\nThe claimant, in his testimony, indicated that he had two encounters with the same three individuals, and his sister was once kidnapped on one occasion. When asked if he filed any report with the police, he stated that he did not. His father told him that things would get worse if he made denunciations against the people loyal to the Fujimori government. The claimant also testified that his father is presently negotiating with the state authorities to return to Peru from the USA to provide evidence against the individuals involved in corruption in Fujimori's government, provided the state authorities would guarantee his safety in Peru. The claimant stated that it is over three weeks since this discussion began-but to date, the claimant's father has not been given any guarantees that state protection will be provided to him should he return to provide evidence they were seeking. The claimant testified that he feared the individuals loyal to the Fujimori administration; as well, he feared that the state authorities would not be able to provide him adequate state protection in Peru.\nThe documentary evidence indicates that:\nPeru is a multiparty republic that has emerged from a decade of authoritarian government and is undergoing a process of democratic transformation. Although it had made significant institutional improvements during the year, the human rights record remained poor in several areas and longstanding problems remained. Police and prison security forces committed seven extrajudicial killings. Impunity remained a problem, and in some cases, the police and security forces threaten or harass victims, their relatives, and witnesses in an attempt to keep them from filing charges of human rights violations. According to Amnesty International, several victims have been too scared to follow through with judicial proceedings against their abusers, who subsequently were released without being charged.6\nThe same document indicates that:\nMany individuals associated with the Fujimori administration are the targets of criminal investigations. Anticorruption legislation enacted in 2000 gave judicial authorities expanded powers to detain witnesses and suspects. Many of those detained under these laws complain that the cases against them are politically motivated, and some of the investigations appeared to have politically partisan overtones.7\nIn regards to being able to obtain protection from the judiciary in Peru, the same document indicates that:\nThe Constitution provides for an independent judiciary; however, in practice the judiciary has been subjected to interference from the executive. It is also subject to corruption and is notably inefficient. Public confidence in the judiciary remains low.8\nIn regards to judges being corrupted and still in power since the government of Fujimori, the documentary evidence indicates that:\nFormer TV commentator Jorge Morelli goes further in this direction, claiming that a majority of judges corrupted by Montesinos remain in their posts, and justice minister Fernando Olivera does not look like he is willing to waste the opportunity to use them.9\nBased on the aforementioned documentary evidence, the panel finds if the claimant were to be returned to Peru, he will be subjected to impunity from his assailants as well as the police who commit serious human rights abuses. Furthermore, because of the existence of the same corrupt judiciary, any evidence given by his father could expose the judges who are still in power since the Fujimori era; and the judgement could affect the claimant and the entire family.\nTherefore, based on the evidence adduced, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that in this case the claimant does not have adequate state protection should he return to Peru.\nThe panel, therefore, concludes that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection and has clearly established that, in his case, the government of Peru is not able to adequately protect him.\nConclusion\nBased on the evidence adduced and the documentary evidence, the panel finds that there is a serious possibility that the claimant will be persecuted at the hands of the agents of Fujimori should he return to Peru.\nAccordingly, for all the abovementioned reasons, the Refugee Protection Division determines that XXXXXXXXXX is a Convention refugee.\n\"S.

The application was filed with the Immigration and Refugee Board on March 8, 2002. The application was originally brought pursuant to ss. 69.2(1) and (4) of the Immigration Act1 before the coming into force of the current Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)2 on June 28, 2002. However, the application continues under the current Act by virtue of s.190. Section 191 of IRPA does not apply, as no substantive evidence had been adduced in this matter prior to the coming into force of IRPA. Therefore, this application was considered under ss.108(2) of IRPA, specifically under the grounds for cessation found at ss.108(1)(a) and (d).3\nAllegations\nXXXXXXXXX (hereinafter \"the respondent\") a citizen of Ukraine was determined to be a Convention refugee by a panel of the Immigration and Refugee Board sitting in Toronto on October 3, 2001.4 According to documentation submitted by the Minister,5 the respondent approached Canadian Immigration authorities on November 23, 2001 to formalize his desire to leave Canada and return to Ukraine, having expressed his desire to leave Canada a few days earlier. He was interviewed by an Immigration officer with an interpreter present and advised that by returning to Ukraine he would be considered to be re-availing himself of the protection of Ukraine. He was further advised that Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) would take steps to have his Convention refugee decision re-determined. He signed a statutory declaration6 confirming that:\n1. He would be leaving Canada to re-join his family in Ukraine of his own free will;\n2. He understood that by returning to Ukraine he would be re-availing himself to its protection;\n3. CIC would be taking steps to vacate the findings of the IRB that determined him a Convention refugee.\nThe respondent then left Canada for Ukraine on December 3, 20017 using a one-way ticket.8\nDetermination\nI find pursuant to ss.108(1)(a) and (2) of IRPA that the respondent has ceased to be a Convention refugee as he has voluntarily re-availed himself of the protection of his country of nationality. As I have allowed the Minister's application under ss.108(1)(a), I\nneed not consider the application under ss.108(1)(d). Pursuant to ss.108(3) of IRPA, the claim of the respondent is deemed rejected.\nThe application of the Minister is allowed.\nAnalysis\nThe Minister in these proceedings has the burden of proof. I agree with the submission of counsel for the Minister that the standard is the ordinary civil standard of a balance of probabilities. The allegations of the Minister were supported with sworn evidence, including the statutory declaration of the respondent. The information contained in Exhibit M-1 satisfies me that the respondent understood that by returning to Ukraine he was risking losing his rights as a Convention refugee in Canada. I am particularly persuaded by the fact that when he first approached CIC he was told to think it over and come back. When he was interviewed a few days later, he was provided with an interpreter. His intention to re-avail himself of the protection of Ukraine is established by his own statutory declaration, as well as the fact that he used a one-way ticket to return to Ukraine. The fact that the Minister would take steps to have his claim re-determined was communicated to him on November 23, 2001, before he left. The Minister's application was served on the respondent at the offices of his last counsel on March 4, 2002.9 The Notice to Appear for this hearing was sent to the respondent at his last known address in Canada on October 20, 2003. I have no evidence before me that the respondent attempted to return to Canada or to oppose the Minister's application. I find that, on a balance of probabilities, the respondent voluntarily returned to Ukraine in December 2001, with the intention of re-availing himself of the protection of Ukraine. I find that the evidence demonstrates, on a balance of probabilities, that the respondent has re-availed himself of the protection of Ukraine.\nConclusion\nThe application of the Minister is allowed.\n\"E.J.

The claimant arrived in Canada in September 2002 and made a claim for refugee status on 23 September 2002.\nThe claimant's Personal Information Form (PIF) was due on 22 November 2002. The claimant, however, did not file his PIF until 19 December 2002. The claimant attended a \"no PIF\" abandonment (PABA) hearing at the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) on 5 February 2002. His case was not abandoned at that time but was ordered to be scheduled normally.\nThe claimant was called for an Assignment Court hearing on 9 July 2003. He attended at that time. On this date he was given the date for his hearing which was set for 16 September 2003 at 8:30 in hearing room 5. He was also given some disclosure documents that would be entered into evidence at his hearing, with an explanation as to what those documents were. He was offered the opportunity to ask any questions concerning the process and was advised of the importance of attending his hearing. In advance of the Assignment Court hearing date, he was provided with a 3-page letter in Spanish that set out clearly important information concerning the process, including the following information (English translation below):\n(1) Claimant Illness -If you are not able to attend your hearing on the date set, whether for medical or other reasons, it is your responsibility to notify the Division in writing at least 2 working days in advance and request a postponement. Unless you are told specifically by the Division that your request has been granted, you must attend on the day set. Your counsel does not have the authority to release you from your obligation to attend. If your absence is for medical reasons you are expected to bring to the Division a detailed medical note from a physician indicating clearly that you are unable to attend your refugee hearing for medical reasons and some indication of when you will be well enough to proceed with your claim. If you are unable to attend for any other reason, similar corroborating evidence will be required. If you have to come from out of town, please make sure you have a back-up plan in case your original travel arrangements fall through.\n(2) Failure to Follow Procedures - Failure to follow these postponement procedures may result in your claim being declared abandoned. Typically, if you fail to appear on the hearing date, or if you are unable to proceed on that date, a new \"show\/cause\" date will be set at which you will be required to explain to the panel why your claim should not be abandoned. Valid reasons are required and the panel must be satisfied that you have made every effort to pursue your claim.\nThe claimant failed to appear at his hearing on 16 September 2003. No explanation was provided to the IRB. Hence, abandonment proceedings were commenced and a \"show-cause\" hearing was set for 9 October 2003 at which the claimant was required to show cause why his claim ought not be abandoned.\nThe claimant did attend on this day. The claimant was asked why he failed to appear at his hearing and he replied that he had been too ill to attend. He explained that the day before the hearing, 15 September 2003, was the anniversary of the independence of Costa Rica. That night he was celebrating with friends and he speculates that he must have eaten something very bad because the next day (the day of the hearing) he was very ill. On the hearing day he alleges he called a Mr. XXXXXX (a man who had helped the claimant prepare his PIF but who is not counsel of record) who apparently advised him to wait until he received the notice to attend the show-cause and explain the circumstances of his illness at the show-cause hearing.\nDecision\nThe claimant failed to show-cause why his case should not be abandoned. This claim is declared abandoned.\nReasons\nThe claimant did not provide a medical certificate. He did not provide a statement from Mr. XXXXXX nor did he call Mr. XXXXXX as a witness. Further, the claimant could not provide a reasonable explanation as to why he did not attempt to contact the IRB on the day of the hearing to notify it that he was too ill to attend. The claimant failed to explain why he did not provide this information on the hearing date or at the earliest possible time after the events allegedly took place. I note the claimant is a savee and well-educated man who is University-educated and an English-speaker. I find on a balance of probabilities the claimant was not ill on the day of the hearing. Moreover, I find his actions in not attending his hearing and not taking steps to advise the IRB directly about his alleged illness reveal an obvious unwillingness to prosecute his claim and belie his allegations of being a person facing a serious possibility of persecution or being a person in need of refugee protection.\nThe claim is abandoned.\n\"Lois D.

XXXXXXXXXXX) is a citizen of St.Vincent. She claims to have a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of her membership in a particular social group; women abused by their common law spouses.\nDetermination:\nI find that the claimant is a Convention refugee, as she does have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in St. Vincent.\nAllegations:\nThe panel has reviewed the Personal Information Form (PIF)1 and the incidents of harm perpetrated against her by XXXXXXXX, and has based its decision on the information contained therein and on the oral testimony provided by the claimant.\nAnalysis:\nThe claimant is alleging the need for refugee protection because she is a victim of domestic violence, which gives her claim a nexus to a Convention ground. I have taken the Chairperson's Gender Guidelines2 into consideration before rendering a decision in this claim.\nIn order to be determined to be a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, the evidence must establish that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution for a Convention ground or must establish that her removal to her country of nationality would subject her personally either (a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture, or (b) to a risk to her life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nThe claimant has based her claim on her membership in a particular social group, that is women who are abused by their spouses. In considering the application on the grounds of spousal abuse, the Supreme Court in Ward3 indicated three categories of particular social group. The panel finds that the basis for her claim falls within the ambit of the first category - groups defined by an innate or unchangeable characteristic.\nThe claimant's difficulty in responding to the questions clearly posed by the panel and counsel was visible. She had a very difficult time remembering the dates of the incidents and often broke down during the hearing. She has a grade 3 education, and her capacity to read and write is very limited. The panel nonetheless accepted her to be a credible and trustworthy witness for reasons outlined more fully later in the reasons.\nThe issue before the panel is whether there is a serious possibility of serious harm to the claimant should she return to her country of origin. In the case before the panel the additional question to be asked is if the claimant is capable of seeking whatever little protection is available to her as an abused woman in St. Vincent.\nThe claimant had sought police protection on several occasions, and finally gave up because they did not help her. The claimant testified particularly about the two incidents when she had approached the police for help. On one occasion, the police released her common-law husband with only a warning, and on another occasion they just took a statement from the claimant, but nothing was done. In the panel's view, her social and educational background would be a barrier to seeking other avenues of redress. She testified that at times she did not have the money to take a bus to the police station and \"just stayed at home took the abuse\". Economic dependency is also an added factor for the continuous abuse and her not moving out of the house.\nThe panel finds that the claimant's psychological vulnerability and the evidence of incidents of persecution do merit a positive determination. In the case at bar, the psychological vulnerability has arisen because of a series of traumatic and stressful incidents of physical assaults and verbal abuse throughout her relationship with XXXX XXXXXX.\nCould the claimant have continued to stay there? The panel thinks not. The panel finds that it is not objectively reasonable for her to continue to stay in St. Vincent for the reasons stated previously in this decision. The cumulative effect of the abuse she suffered at the hands of XXXXXXXXX, her economic dependency on him and her unsuccessful attempts to obtain effective protection from the police resulted in a nervous breakdown, as attested by the psychological4 report.\nThe panel found the testimony of the claimant to be credible. The demeanor of the claimant when testifying about this period in her life was indeed very genuine and credible. She stated that the past events in her life had resulted in a nervous breakdown. The demeanor of the claimant throughout the hearing demonstrated a sense of fear, even of the panel member. Her testimony was credible, and her reason for not seeking help from the authorities was simply that she was scared.\nThe claimant's situation has to be assessed against the standard of protection required of a nation, and is described in the Federal Court of Appeal decision Zalzali as: \"...adequate though not necessarily perfect\".5\nThere is some information before the panel regarding legal avenues that are open to women, although only a small amount actually addresses the issue of protection. In the Response to Information Request6 there is a reference to the Domestic Violence Act in 1995. The claimant was asked at the hearing if she was aware of the avenues open to abused women\nin her country of origin. She stated that she has never heard of these avenues and she only went to the police and when they did not help, she just took the abuse.\nDocumentary evidence on state protection available for abused women is mixed. In the panel's view the claimant is not capable of accessing even what is available.\nFindings:\nIn conclusion the panel finds that there is a serious possibility in the particular circumstance before the panel that the claimant would continue to face persecution for which she would not receive adequate protection from the state.\nConclusion:\nTherefore, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (a.k.a. XXXXXXXXXXX) is determined to be a Convention refugee.\n\"Veda Rangan\"\nVeda Rangan\nDATED at Toronto this 26th day of May 2003.\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - WOMEN REFUGEES - GENDER - PARTICULAR SOCIAL GROUP - DOMESTIC VIOLENCE - GENDER-RELATED PERSECUTION - VULNERABLE GROUPS - STATE PROTECTION - FEMALE - POSITIVE - SAINT VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES\n1 Exhibit C-1.\n2 Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution: Guidelines Issued by the Chairperson Pursuant to Section 65(3) of the Immigration Act, IRB, Ottawa, March 9, 1993, Update: November 1996, as continued in effect by the Chairperson on June 28, 2002 pursuant to section 159(1)(h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n3 Canada (Attorney General) v.

She arrived in Canada on July 24, 2002. On November 14, 2002 she made a claim to refugee protection and was served with her Personal Information Form (PIF) in person. In accordance with Rule 6(1) of the Refugee Protection Division Rules, she was required to provide her completed PIF to the RPD no later than December 12, 2002.\nThe PIF form itself and the Notice to Appear given to the claimant by the Immigration Officer (IMM 5292) state clearly the obligation to provide the PIF to the Division within 28 days; the officer wrote the due date, \"Dec. 12\" on the IMM 5292 for the claimant. On November 21, 2002, the Division sent a \"first contact\" letter to the claimant, informing her of her RPD file number and under the heading, \"Steps in the Refugee Claim Process\", of her obligation to send her completed PIF to the IRB within 28 days from the date she received it. A copy of the letter was sent to Lala Ramoun, identified as her counsel on the \"Information on Individuals Seeking Refugee Protection\" form (IMM 5500) the claimant completed when she initiated her claim. The claimant did not submit her PIF within the required period of time.\nOn December 17, 2002, solicitor Robin Morch advised the RPD by fax that he had\nbeen retained by the claimant as counsel and requested an extension of time until January 28, 2003, almost 7 weeks after the due date, to complete the PIF. In accordance with the Commentary to Rule 6(2),1 consideration of the extension request was deferred to a special hearing on January 24, 2003. A Notice to Appear at an Abandonment hearing was accordingly served on the claimant and on counsel Morch on December 18, 2002. The claimant appeared at the hearing and presented her PIF to the panel at that time, 43 days after it was due. Counsel Morch did not appear, but sent a letter stating:\nI apologise for the late filing. However despite the fact that she applied for legal aid in a timely fashion, a certificate for PIF preparation and RPD representation was not received in my office until the 15th January, 2003.\nThe claimant was asked to explain the delay in submitting her PIF.\nThe claimant stated that she had not begun to take steps to pursue her claim (i.e., apply for Legal Aid and welfare) until December 10, 2002 (2 days before her PIF was due) because her lack of knowledge of the English language made it difficult for her to\nfigure out what to do with the papers she had been given. She said she consulted acquaintances.\nAt this point, the claimant was sworn and asked to explain the inconsistencies between the explanation she had provided and the statement on the IMM 5500 she completed on November 14, 2002 that the person who had interpreted her PIF, Lala Ramoun, was her counsel and also her host in Canada.2 The \"In-Person Refugee Intake Record of Examination\" form completed when the claimant made her claim indicates that Ms. Ramoun was present at the Immigration Office with the claimant.\nThe claimant reiterated that she was unable to prepare her PIF until she had a consultation. Asked when she had first contacted her \"counsel and host\" Ms. Ramoun about preparing the PIF, she stated that it was not until she received the Notice to Appear at the Abandonment hearing. Her explanation for failing to contact Ms. Ramoun until sometime after December 18, 2002 was that Ms. Ramoun did not have time to deal with her.\nI find that the claimant's explanation for the delay in submitting her PIF is not satisfactory. While the actions - and inaction - of Ms. Ramoun, the claimant's alleged \"host\" in Canada, give rise to questions, the claimant herself has a responsibility to pursue her claim with diligence. In Gulishvili,3 referring to Mathon4 and Shirwa,5 Kelen J. states (at paragraph 15):\nBoth cases are clear that there must be no fault of the applicant in such matters where the negligence or error of counsel provides grounds for judicial review.\nBy her own testimony, the claimant did nothing to pursue her claim, beyond vague conversations with acquaintances, until December 10, 2002, when she initiated her application for Legal Aid. I do not agree with counsel Morch's submissions that the claimant applied for Legal Aid in a timely fashion.\nThe claimant took no concrete steps to complete her PIF until sometime after December 18, 2002 when, prompted by a Notice to Appear at an Abandonment hearing, she contacted Ms. Ramoun. The claimant's explanations for the delay in completing her PIF (lack of knowledge of English, the need to consult someone, Ms. Ramoun's lack of time) are not credible in light of the fact that the claimant was in contact with the person who interpreted her PIF at the time she made her claim and in light of her ability to begin the process of applying for Legal Aid and welfare at least by December 10, 2002.\nI find that the claimant did not act in a diligent manner and bears responsibility for her failure to submit her PIF within the required period of time. I also find that there is no justifiable reason for the delay in submitting her PIF within the required period of time. Indeed, the PIF was not completed and presented until January 24, 2003, 43 days after it was due. Accordingly, I find the claimant to be in default of the proceedings in accordance with s.168(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nThe panel took into account the fact that the claimant presented a completed PIF at the abandonment hearing, but did not find this to be determinative of the issue.6\nMoreover, I find that the claimant did not seek an extension of time to complete her PIF in a timely manner, having waited until after the 28-day period for completing the PIF had elapsed. Again, I find that the claimant did not present a justifiable reason for the delay. An extension of time to file the PIF will not therefore be granted.\nI, therefore, declare the claim of XXXXXXXXXXXX to have been abandoned.\n\"Patricia Rucker\"\nPatricia Rucker\nDATED at Toronto this 31st day of March, 2003.\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - ABANDONMENT - PERSONAL INFORMATION FORM - DELAY -TIME LIMIT - TIME PERIODS - TIMING - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION RULES - APPLICATION - PRACTICE - PROCEDURE - FEMALE - DENIED - UKRAINE\n1 An application for an extension of time received after the 28-day time limit will be considered at a special hearing held under subsection 58(2) of the Refugee Protection Division Rules. At that hearing, the claimant will be given a chance to explain the delay in filing the Personal Information Form. The claimant should make every effort to provide a completed Personal Information Form to the Division before or at the special hearing. If there is no justifiable reason for the delay, the Division may declare the claim to be abandoned (Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, subsection 168(1)).\n2 Response to Question #20, \"Your host in Canada (friend or relative).\"\n3 Gulishvili, Lina v.

This claimant was born in the USA and as such is a citizen of that country. The adult claimants asked at the beginning of the hearing that this claim be withdrawn. I accepted this application and withdrew the refugee claim of XXXXXXXXXX (TA3-00974).\nALLEGATIONS\nThe principal claimant acknowledges that they fled Pakistan in August 1996 due to a fear of serious harm at the hands of the Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP) and religious extremists as a result of various threats and attacks including:\n* XXXXX 1995 - phone calls threatening to kidnap the daughters;\n* XXXXX 1996 - the principal claimant was attacked after answering a knock at his door.\nThe principal claimant attempted to relocate in Lahore but within a few days his host was contacted by the SSP and the claimant was told to leave.\nThe principal claimant further outlined how his various attempts to seek the help of the police were not successful.\nAs a result the principal claimant used his valid US visitor visa and fled to the USA in August 1996. His family joined him in October 1996. As a result of the USA asking citizens of Pakistan to register the claimants came to Canada in January 2003.\nDETERMINATION\nThe claimants did not discharge their burden of proof sufficient to establish, on a balance of probabilities, the existence of a subjective fear of returning to Pakistan. I reject the claims.\nANALYSIS\nWhen the principal claimant arrived in the USA, in August 1996, he was granted a visitor permit valid until February 1997. The claimant testified that on or about October 1996 he inquired of a lawyer of the possibility of making a claim for asylum in the USA. The advice he received persuaded the claimant that there was little chance of his claim being successful and if unsuccessful he would be deported to Pakistan. As a result the claimants did not pursue a claim for asylum at that time.\nWhen asked what steps the principal claimant took to legalize his status in the USA after his visitor permit expired in February 1997, he responded that in or around the beginning of 1998 he applied for a labour certificate and although he was granted the certificate because he was working in the information technologies area, in December 2001, he was refused a green card by the INS.\nThe female adult claimant (the principal claimant's wife) testified that her sister initiated sponsorship of the female claimant and the children in the USA sometime in 1998. This application is still outstanding.\nBoth adult claimants agreed the application for a green card and the sponsorship application did not give the claimants status in the USA nor did these applications protect them from deportation.\nThe principal claimant outlined how in the fall of 1997 he contacted a second lawyer who told the principal claimant he would have had a very good claim had it not been for the fact that by this time the claimants had been in the USA for more than a year and their application for asylum would be denied on the basis they were untimely.\nThe claimants testified that no attempt had been made to extend the six month permit when it expired in February 1997.\nFurther the evidence is the principal claimant waited until the fall of 1997 to seek a second legal opinion. The principal claimant agreed that after the second legal opinion in October 1997 they feared deportation as they feared for their lives in Pakistan.\nWhen asked if they were convinced no claim could be made in the USA why they did not seek refuge in a different country such as Canada at that time, they responded Canada did not come to their mind. The Refugee Protection Officer (RPO) asked the female adult claimant about her brother who is a landed immigrant here in Canada and why they did not come and join him in Canada and make a refugee claim. She responded that the family decisions about such matters rests with her in-laws and it was not proper for her family to get involved.\nI do not accept this explanation. The female claimant accepted the help of her sister in the USA with regard to the sponsorship. In addition the female claimant often interrupted her husband's evidence to add what she considered the important points he was missing. She presented herself as intelligent and very aware of various laws and statutes that could affect the claims of the various members of the family.\nAfter reviewing the evidence I am satisfied that various actions or lack of actions to legalize their status while living outside Pakistan are not those of persons who fear for their lives or other forms of serious harm if returned to Pakistan.\nIn February 1997 the principal claimant was in the USA illegally. His testimony was he knew he was at risk of deportation to Pakistan, a country where he allegedly fears for his life. I do not accept his explanation that he was prepared to take this risk of deportation on the basis that deportation was less likely to happen than his being killed in Pakistan if he returned.\nIn February 1997 the principal claimant had a number of options available to him.\n1) Seek a second legal opinion. The fact that he was prepared to wait until the fall of 1997 before taking this step I find inconsistent with a fear of being returned to Pakistan.\n2) Make a claim for asylum in spite of his legal advice. The USA has signed the 1967 Protocol relating to the status of refugees and has in place a fully developed process for dealing with claimants seeking protection within the USA. Every refugee claim has two possible outcomes and I accept there is always a risk of having the claim rejected and perhaps being deported to Pakistan. However the reality in not making a claim, on a balance of probabilities, is that it increases the risk of deportation. I accept the claimants made various attempts to legalize their stay in the USA. Each of these I note had the possibility of being unsuccessful just as a claim for asylum. In fact by 2001 the application for a work permit was rejected by the INS. During these applications the claimants knew they were at risk of deportation if discovered in the USA. The fact the adult claimants were prepared to risk deportation by coming forward yet did not make a claim for refugee protection, I find inconsistent with the actions I would, on a balance of probabilities, expect of persons who feared for their lives if returned to Pakistan.\n3) If the principal claimant truly believed in February 1997 he could not with any degree of safety make an application for asylum in the USA, then at that time he could have left the USA and come to Canada and made a refugee claim here. Considering his brother-in-law was in Canada at this time I would expect, on a balance of probabilities, the principal claimant and his wife to discuss this option with the brother-in-law. The wife's explanation that she did not want to call on her relatives for help, I reject. Her actions are that she was prepared to use her sister living in the USA to provide sponsorship in that country. That being the case I reject she was not prepared to seek the assistance of her brother in Canada at least to the level of inquiry regarding the possibility of a refugee claim.\nI find, on a balance of probabilities, the failure of the claimants to come to Canada and make a claim during the six years, February 1997 to January 2003 another example of actions not consistent with what I would expect of persons who fear serious harm if returned to Pakistan.\nFurther in the six years between becoming illegal residents in the USA and fleeing to Canada the principal claimant maintained employment, the adult claimants had a son who enjoys US citizenship, and the minor claimants attended various schools in the USA.\nI find the claimants' actions of living openly in the USA without seeking protection once again inconsistent with the actions I would expect of persons who fear for their lives if returned to Pakistan.\nCOUNSEL'S SUBMISSIONS (EXHIBIT C-9)\nParagraph 10. Counsel suggests that refugee protection is to be afforded on \"purely humanitarian grounds.\" This is the case in another forum but I am not afforded this option by the current Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\nParagraph 12. Counsel notes for my consideration that error by the Board should be on the side of caution. The UNHCR Handbook, in paragraphs 196 and 203-204, also outlines the conditions when it is appropriate for the panel to afford the claimant(s) the benefit of the doubt. When I considered all the evidence in this case concerning the time between leaving Pakistan and making a claim in Canada I am satisfied the preponderance of the actions are not those of persons who fear serious harm in their home country. As a result I am satisfied that it would be inconsistent with the IRPA if I was to give the benefit of the doubt in this case.\nSince I am satisfied that the claimant's stated subjective fear has not been established, on a balance of probabilities, and hence the claim fails, I have not analysed issues such as credibility, state protection or IFA, which were canvassed during the hearing.\nI would note with regard to counsel's submissions a number of areas where I would not arrive at his conclusion based on the evidence before me.\nFirst I agree that the principal claimant's identity as a Shia was accepted at the hearing.\nI do not agree the omissions of any mention of the claimant's role in the Welfare Association or of having the back window of his car shot out are minor in nature. These are core elements of the claim supporting the reason that this Shia citizen is being targeted. Their omissions would cause me to doubt the accuracy of this testimony.\nCounsel in his submissions on page 8 in the second full paragraph states: \"The SSP is today as strong as in the past - rather stronger and there has been no decrease in their activities.\" (emphasis added) I find this statement not supported by the documents in Exhibit R-1. I agree the efforts have not been perfect but I would refer counsel to his own document, page 12 of these submissions, item 39, where it notes that in Karachi (generally accepted as one of the hot beds of SSP activity) there were 10 killings of Shia in 2002 and yet in 2001 the total was 107. In fact the next lowest number of any year referenced is 85.\nI do not accept counsel's submissions there has been no decrease in the actions of the SSP. If I was to do a fulsome analysis of state protection for Shias post 2002, the only question before me would be are these efforts sufficient. It is a matter of record that there have been improvements.\nParagraph 28. Counsel submits the RPO has not established that the principal claimant would not be subjected to any persecution. Counsel goes on to remind the panel of the accepted test of serious possibility, reasonable chance, good grounds.\nParagraph 30. Counsel submits that the evidence shows the claimant has good grounds to fear persecution by the SSP.\nThe question I have analysed is if the claimant's actions are consistent with such a fear and I have found they are not. AI identifies categories of Shias who are most at risk (Exhibit R-1, item 1.15, section II). The claimant's profile does not place him in these categories.\nI am satisfied the principal claimant's actions from 1997 until 2003 are the actions of a person who does not consider himself the target of the SSP. It is the claimant's actions that satisfy me that he believes he and his family could return to Pakistan with not more than a mere possibility of serious harm. If this was not the case, I am satisfied the claimant's would have taken different courses of action after leaving Pakistan.\nSUMMARY\nThe principal claimant feared he would be murdered if returned to his country of origin.\nThe principal claimant and his family lived openly for six years in a country with a refugee determination process in place.\nThe principal claimant knew he was at risk of deportation if discovered.\nOver this prolonged period of time no claim for refugee protection was made and the explanation for this lack of action was not accepted.\nIt is these actions that I find not to be consistent with a person who truly fears serious harm in his country of reference.\nCONCLUSION\nThe claimants must support their claim with credible and trustworthy evidence sufficient to satisfy both the subjective and objective components of a well-founded fear. In this case the subjective component, on a balance of probabilities, has not been established.1 Hence the claim is rejected on that basis pursuant to section 96 and\/or section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\nThe Refugee Protection Division rejects the claims of XXXXXXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXXX, and XXXXXXXXXXX.\n\"Cliff Berry\"\nCliff Berry\nDATED at Toronto this 8th day of July, 2003.\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - SUBJECTIVE ELEMENT - DELAY - CREDIBILITY - MALE - FEMALE - NEGATIVE\n1 Cruz, Fernando Rodriguez v.

The first three claimants are citizens of Pakistan, while XXXXXXXX is a citizen of the United States of America. The show cause hearing to give the claimants an opportunity to explain the late filing of their Personal Information Forms (PIFs) took place on 22 May 2003. The claimants were represented by counsel, Max Berger, Barrister and Solicitor. An interpreter proficient in the Urdu and English languages was present throughout the proceedings. The father, XXXXXXXXXXXXXX, was designated as the representative for the minor claimants, XXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXX.\nBACKGROUND\nThe following is a summary of the facts, which have not been disputed, ascertained at the outset of the \"show cause\" hearing:\n* The claimants' claims were referred to the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) by Citizenship and Immigration Canada (C.I.C.) at Fort Erie, Ontario on 9 February 2003; on the same day the claimants received their PIFs and information concerning Canada's refugee protection system and process;\n* From June 2000 and prior to coming to Canada, the claimants resided in the United States, where the younger of the two minor claimants was born on XXXXXXXX 2000;\n* The claimants' PIFs were due on 9 March 2003, 28 days after being provided the forms in person at Fort Erie;\n* On 6 March 2003, some three days before the PIFs were due, the RPD received a \"Notification of Counsel\" from the claimants' counsel, along with a request for a three-week extension for the claimants' PIFs, due to the delay in Legal Aid authorization.\n* The claimants' IRB file shows that an extension was granted to 30 March 2003;\n* Not having received the claimants' PIFs by the extended due date, a \"Notice to Appear - Abandonment of a Claim for Refugee Protection\", was served on the claimants and their counsel on 16 April 2003.\n* The claimants' PIFs were received on 10 April 2003, some 11 days after the extended due date, and some 32 days after the original due date.\n* A show cause hearing was initially scheduled for 21 May 2003. Counsel's agent, Mr. Asif requested on counsel's behalf a brief postponement to 22 May 2003, to give counsel an opportunity to appear and to make submissions. The request was granted.\n* The explanation for the delay in submitting the PIFs beyond the extended due date was addressed in counsel's submissions as outlined below.\nCOUNSEL'S SUBMISSIONS AND THE MEMBER'S ANALYSIS\nOn 22 May 2003 counsel for the claimants made oral submissions, which he requested to be applied to other No PIF Abandonment hearings concerning other of his clients who had also been served similar \"Notices to Appear\" (counsel called these his \"global\" submission). Additional submissions, this time in writing, were sent by counsel on 27 May 2003 and on 2 June 2003. In all, counsel raised seven main points challenging the fairness of the 28-day PIF requirement and other aspects of the No PIF Abandonment process. The following is a summary of each of counsel's points and the Member's analysis.\n1. Breach of natural justice\nIn his first point, counsel argued a serious breach of natural justice with respect to what he perceived to be a change of policy in the disposition of PIF abandonment matters. Counsel argued that until the introduction of the RPD's move to centralize the No PIF Abandonment hearings some 10 days ago (the new centralized processing unit was announced in LexChange (a case management bulletin published by the Toronto Region of the IRB), Vol. 4, No. 1, May 2003), \"...the Board has had a history or policy of lifting abandonment if the PIF is in prior to the abandonment hearing.\" In counsel's opinion, \"...there's a serious breach of natural justice if the Board decides suddenly and without giving notice to change that policy.\" Counsel argued further that the new RPD Rules are not different from the pre-June 28, 2002 CRDD Rules, thus \"...if there is actually nothing new in the Rules on the 28 day issue and if the Board wants to dramatically change that policy, natural justice dictates that the direction be done by way of a very explicit practice notice.\"\nIn my opinion, counsel's argument regarding an allegation of lack of notice overlooked some clear and repeated instructions and appears to be based on a misapprehension of facts. His point about there being nothing new in the Rules is also incorrect.\nThe issue of notice needs to be addressed not only in the formal announcements to counsel, but also in what is normally provided to the claimants upon making claims for refugee protection. First and foremost, there is the RPD Rule 6(1) which simply states:\n6.(1) The claimant must provide to the Division the original and two copies of the completed Personal Information Form by one of the means, other than fax or electronic mail, described in Rule 33. The completed forms must be received by the Division no later than 28 days after the claimant received the form. [emphasis added]\nThe IRB Commentaries to the RPD Rules state the following regarding Rules 5 and 6:\nWhen the claimant received he Personal Information Form\nThe claimant will receive the Personal Information Form in one of two ways: it is either handed to the claimant or sent to the claimant by mail. If the Personal Information Form is handed to the claimant, it is considered to be received that same day. If it is sent by regular mail, it is considered to be received seven days after the date it is mailed...\nUnder \"Providing the Personal Information Form to the Division\" the Commentary states as follows:\nThe completed Personal Information Form may be delivered by hand or courier or it may be sent to the Division office indicated at the bottom of the Notice to Appear. If the Personal Information Form is sent by regular mail, the claimant must still ensure that the Division actually receives it within 28 days. A Personal Information Form cannot be faxed or sent by e-mail. [emphasis added]\nIt is worth pointing out that the claimants are repeatedly reminded of the 28-day requirement in the documents given to them: on the C.I.C. issued Notice to Appear, on the front of the Personal Information Form itself, under \"Instructions\", and in the booklet included in the Personal Information Form kit, \"Refugee Protection in Canada: Claimant's Guide\". Moreover, in the first letter sent to the claimants by the RPD following the receipt of the referrals from the C.I.C. (in the case of the present claimants the letter was sent to them on 13 February 2003), under \"Steps in the Refugee Claim Process\", the claimants are advised as follows:\nYou must send your completed Personal Information Form (PIF) to the IRB within 28 days from the date you received it. If you need help filling it out, please read the \"Instructions\" section on page one of the form. If you do not send in your PIF within 28 days, the IRB may decide that you have abandoned your claim and you may lose the right to proceed with your claim. [emphasis added]\nCounsel's argument regarding the RPD's alleged practice of \"lifting\" the abandonment as long as the claimant had provided a completed PIF prior to the abandonment hearing, is simply incorrect. It has been the RPD's practice since June 28, 2002 when the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) came into force and previously that of the Convention Refugee Determination Division (CRDD) under the previous Immigration Act, to enforce the filing of the PIFs in a timely manner in accordance with the RPD\/CRDD Rules. This was made abundantly clear with the issuance of the Practice Notice on the \"Timely Filing of Personal Information Forms\" dated 5 May 1998.\nCounsel and claimants are hereby notified that, effective immediately, the Refugee Division will require strict adherence to the prescribed time frames set out in the Rules for the filing of PIFs. If a PIF is not filed within the prescribed time, a notice to appear for a show cause hearing will be issued.\nApplications for extensions of time for filing a PIF will be considered if they are made within 28 days of the PIF being served on the claimant. Extensions of time will only be granted if there is a justifiable reason for the delay. Any applications for an extension of time received after the 28 days will only be considered at the show cause hearing. At the show cause hearing the claimant may make submissions as to the delay in filing. If there is no justifiable reason for the delay in filing, the claim may be declared abandoned.\nIn the parallel provision regarding Rules 5 and 6 the IRB Commentary states:\nRules 5 and 6: Personal Information Form\nFailure to provide a Personal Information Form or providing an incomplete Personal Information Form\nThe Division must actually receive the Personal Information Form no later than 28 days after it was received by the claimant. The Personal Information Form must also be complete. If the Division does not receive the Personal Information Form within 28 days or if the Personal Information Form is not complete, a special hearing will be held under subsection 58(2) of the RPD Rules to decide whether the claim should be declared abandoned [Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, subsection 168(1)]. The claimant will be given a chance to explain the delay or default and give reasons why the claim should not be declared abandoned.\nIn all instances in which a PIF had not been received on time, a show cause hearing was held. Only when cause was found to have been shown was the claim not abandoned. Counsel's statement that the abandonment was simply \"lifted\" is not an informed one and does not correspond to RPD's actual practice.\nBut even if counsel was correct in his assertion that it was the RPD's practice not to abandon claims at No PIF Abandonment hearings if the claimant produced the PIF after the due date but prior to or at the No PIF Abandonment hearing date, which in my opinion he was not, his argument that the RPD failed to provide counsel and claimants a notice with regard to what counsel calls a change of policy, is simply wrong. Apart from the RPD Rules 5 and 6, the IRB Commentary on the same Rules, and the clear instructions regarding the 28-day requirement, a Special Edition of LexChange dated August 2002, distributed to all counsels appearing before the IRB's three Divisions, and posted on each IRB hearing room floor and available at the Documentation Centre and the IRB web-site, stated as follows:\nTime Lines and Other Requirements under the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) Rules\nThe RPD Rules contain important requirements about when and how various documents and notices are to be provided to the Division. Some of these rules are highlighted below. It is important to become familiar with the new Rules because the RPD expects that all hearing participants will be diligent in following them.\nPersonal Information Form (PIF)\nThe RPD must receive the original PIF and two copies, together with copies of the claimant's identity, travel, and other relevant documents, no later than 28 days after the claimant received the form. (If the PIF was mailed to the claimant, add 7 days from the date it was mailed to the claimant.) The PIF cannot be faxed. A completed PIF must be provided for each claimant.\nIn another issue of LexChange, Vol. 3, No. 1, October 2002, it was conveyed to counsels that PIFs which were missing the interpreter's declaration would be considered incomplete and therefore subject to No PIF Abandonment proceedings. In addition to all of the above, on March 7, 2003, at an information meeting of the RPD to which all counsels appearing before the RPD were invited, the topic of PIF completion and delivery was on the agenda and the message of the RPD's intention to enforce the 28-day rule was reiterated.\nAll of the above preceded the decision to centralize the No PIF Abandonment process effective May 2003, even though centralizing this particular and a few other functions did not constitute a change in policy, only a reorganization of resources and a focused approach to ensure a consistent application of the RPD Rules.\nCounsel asserts that there is nothing new about the RPD Rules, as the previous CRDD Rules also required the PIF to be submitted within 28 days. Although there are similarities, the RPD and CRDD Rules on the time limits for PIFs differ in that the CRDD allowed an additional seven days to file the PIF if the filing was by mail. If one considers that seven days was also allowed for the mailing of the PIF by the Senior Immigration Officer, as is still the case under the RPD Rules, a total of 14 days were actually tacked on to the 28 days. However, I do not consider this point significant, considering the already clear statement in RPD Rule 6, that the PIF must be received by the RPD no later than 28 days after the claimant received the PIF from an officer, followed by clear and repeated messages that the RPD expected claimants and counsel to be diligent in following it.\n2. Counsel's advice to claimants\nCounsel's second argument is closely related to his submission on the first point. In response to the claimants' queries regarding the 28-day time frame within which to file their PIFs, he advised them to do it to the extent possible, but if they are late, he also advised them that as long as the PIF is received prior to the abandonment hearing date they will likely suffer no adverse consequences.\nI will leave it to counsel to sort out the prudence of the second part of his advice to his clients. However, in the light of the information discussed in response to counsel's first submission, I see no justification for such advice to have been given. I see even less justification for such advice to have been accepted by the claimants given the clear instructions they have been consistently provided, including the information from the RPD that if the PIFs are not received on time (in the present claims by the extended due date of 30 March 2003), the IRB may decide that the claimants have abandoned their claims.\n3. Legal Aid and other claimant difficulties\nIn the third point of his submissions, counsel challenged the reasonableness of the 28-day PIF requirement and gave examples of difficulties claimants encounter in general, and claimants coming from the United States who are Pakistani (like the present claimants) citizens in particular, in complying with the requirement, most notably the complications with Legal Aid. Counsel stated:\nThe 28 day rule I suspect was set out by Immigration bureaucrats who simply are not clued in to the difficulties and the many steps required for a refugee to submit his Personal Information Form.\n[...] It takes time, which is several days time to consult within their community to see who would be a suitable lawyer to represent them. Then it takes time to get an appointment with the lawyer. That takes another few days.\nAll of these claimants have applied for Legal Aid coverage. Legal Aid now is no longer a straightforward matter for Pakistani refugee claimants. Most Pakistani claimants are issued Legal Aid certificates for what is described as an opinion letter. That certificate on its face [...] specifically sets out that preparation of the PIF is not authorised at this time.\n[...] one has to wait seven to 14 days for the Legal Aid Area Committee to convene to make a decision on the opinion letter. Legal Aid has increasingly taken the position that those Pakistani claimants coming from an over one year stay in America are not getting the full Legal Aid coverage. For those claimants who are refused Legal Aid then begins the search for funds [...] to hire a lawyer privately. By this time the 28 days has already usually lapsed and that is generally why we are in this situation here today.\nCounsel's views of \"Immigration bureaucrats\" are not important and will not be commented upon, even though counsel's underlying view of how the RPD Rules came about is oversimplified. However, and more importantly, I do not agree with counsel that the 28-day requirement is an unreasonable one. While the RPD has discretion to consider whether exceptional circumstances exist in individual cases, I share the opinion that in normal circumstances the 28-day PIF requirement as set out RPD Rule 6 is a reasonable expectation and consistent with principles of fairness.\nCounsel's point about the claimants' need \"to consult with their community to see who would be a suitable lawyer to represent them\" appears to have more to do with the limitations of choice of counsel and the availability of that counsel, than with the unreasonableness of the 28-day PIF expectation. The limitations of a claimant's choice of counsel has been dealt with in the Federal Court decision of Pilnitz, Viktor v. M.C.I.1 as follows:\nThe cases hold, of course, that a person is entitled to choose his or her counsel. However, this choice is not unlimited. A person must choose an attorney who is able to appear within the time limits laid down by the court or tribunal that has jurisdiction.\nThus, it stands in the claims before the RPD that the claimant's choice is limited by the 28-day requirement. The claimant cannot invoke the right to counsel of choice if the counsel in question is not available to assist with the PIF completion within the prescribed time.\nTurning to the issue of Legal Aid, it is the RPD's position that the failure to obtain\nsuch aid is not in and of itself a basis for extending the PIF deadline. Whether state-funded or privately financed, the question of retainer arrangements is a matter between the claimant and counsel, and is not determinative of how the RPD manages its process. This position is regularly taken by the Federal Court2 with respect to its own proceedings. Given that the proceedings before the RPD are, for the most part, non-adversarial and not bound by formal rules of evidence, the absence of Legal Aid is not on its own a sufficient basis to extend the deadline for providing PIFs. Counsel's own submission points out that the Legal Aid application process can be a lengthy one and that some applicants are found not to qualify. Since Legal Aid is not guaranteed, all the more reason for the claimants to undertake alternative steps in order to comply with the 28-day time frame.\n4. RPD Rule 58(3)\nIn the last point of his oral submission, counsel referred to RPD Rule 58(3) which reads:\nFactors to consider\n58.(3)The Division must consider, in deciding if the claim should be declared abandoned, the explanations given by the claimant at the hearing and any other relevant information, including the fact that the claimant is ready to start or continue the proceedings.\nIn pointing out on behalf of the claimants that they were ready to continue their proceedings and given that this factor was specifically set out in the RPD Rule, counsel argued that \"...there would have to be some very strong and powerful contrary factors for a claim to be declared abandoned...\"\nMy assessment of counsel's argument is that it is too narrow. The claimants' readiness to continue with their claims, while a factor to be considered, along with other factors where they exist, is not determinative. Failure to provide their PIFs by the deadline gave rise to the convening of an abandonment or a show cause hearing. The preparedness of the claimants to continue with the claim for protection proceedings does not set aside or render unnecessary or redundant the claimants' explanation for the delay in filing their PIFs. The main purpose of the abandonment hearing is to assess the reasonableness of the claimants' explanation and then proceed to decide, taking into account all the relevant information. This position has been upheld by the Federal Court in Ghassan, Daher v. M.E.I.3 Specifically, the Federal Court rejected the argument that as long as the claimant produced a PIF at the show cause hearing, this was evidence of intent to proceed with the claim and therefore it was simply not possible to abandon the claim:\nI do not share this view. Accepting such reasoning would nullify the effect of the provision of s. 46.03(2) of the [Immigration] Act, according to which a person whose claim is referred to the Refugee Division must provide the Division with such information as is required by the Rules in the manner and within the period prescribed, namely within twenty-eight days. When pursuant to s. 69.1(6)(b) of the Act, the Refugee Division gives the person concerned an opportunity to be heard, it is the very purpose of that abandonment hearing to allow the person concerned to explain the reasons why he believes he did not abandon the claim. It is only when the Refugee Division has allowed the claimant to explain his reasons and concluded that they were valid that it may proceed to hear the claim.\nIn my opinion, the same principles are applicable to the provisions under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) s. 168(1) and RPD Rule 58(3).\n5. RPD's loss of jurisdiction to abandon\nIn his first written submission counsel expanded on his argument regarding RPD Rule 58, this time from the point of view of section 168(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), suggesting that once the PIF has been received, since there is no further \"information required by the Division,\" the Division therefore no longer has jurisdiction to declare a claim to be abandoned:\nI would read s. 168(1) of IRPA with rule 58 of the RPD Rules as giving the Board jurisdiction to call the claimant in for an abandonment hearing if the Personal Information Form has not been received after the 28 day deadline. If the Personal Information Form still has not been received by the date of the abandonment hearing then it follows that the claimant has failed \"to provide information required by the Division\" and the Board has the jurisdiction to declare the claim abandoned. On the other hand if the Personal Information Form has been submitted on or before the date of the abandonment hearing, it cannot be said that \"information required by the Division\" has not been submitted and therefore the Board would be without jurisdiction to declare the claim abandoned. Once again my argument flows from the fact that there is no reference whatsoever to the 28 days deadline within s. 168(1) of IRPA.\nI do not agree with counsel's interpretation. I find that his argument focuses on a subordinate example rather than on the provision's first plan or main point regarding \"default in the proceedings\". Section 168(1) reads in full:\n68.(1) A Division may determine that a proceeding before it has been abandoned if the Division is of the opinion that the applicant is in default in the proceeding, including by failing to appear for a hearing, to provide information required by the Division or to communicate with the Division on being requested to do so.\nIn my opinion, it is reasonable to conclude that the claimant is \"in default in the proceedings\" when the PIF has not been received in time. The remedy is not simply to file the PIF before or at the No PIF Abandonment hearing, as it is not enough simply to show one is ready to continue with the proceedings, but it is necessary to provide a reasonable explanation for being in default in the first place. In considering whether the explanation is reasonable, the availability of the PIF before or at the abandonment hearing is a consideration, but not the sole cure. The fact that there is no specific reference to the 28-day PIF deadline in section 168(1) is of itself inconsequential, since the subsection refers to the more general situation of \"default\", which includes providing \"information required by the Division\". As noted above, the abandonment provisions, including the timely receipt of the PIF is covered in RPD Rule 58. Moreover, section 161(1) allows the Chairperson to make rules respecting (a) the activities, practice and procedure of each of the Divisions and (c) the information that may be required and the manner in which, and the time within which, it must be provided with respect to a proceeding before the Board.\nIn my opinion, the guidance provided by the Federal Court in Ghassan cited earlier, where the CRDD rejected the claimant's explanations for the delay in filing his PIF and declared the claim abandoned, supports my response to this particular argument by counsel.\n6. Delay in receiving Port of Entry Notes\nCounsel's next argument concerns the issue of the Port of Entry notes and the delay in obtaining these prior to completing the PIFs. (I note that in the case of the present claimants the Port of Entry notes were sent to counsel on 11 March 2003, some 5 days after they were requested by counsel.) Based on his reading of the Supreme Court of Canada decision of R. v. Stinchcombe4 and the issue of disclosure, along with his arguments regarding the importance of these materials for the preparation of PIF narratives, in the event of adverse credibility comments by immigration officers, counsel states:\nIf the decision with respect to disclosure in Stinchome is to have any meaning, then the 28 day period by which to file the PIF must be lengthened by the time delay in forwarding the port of entry notes to counsel from the date of the request. Therefore in my submission if there is a 14 day delay in counsel obtaining the notes from the date of the request, consequently the 28 day period in which to file the PIF must correspondingly be lengthened by 14 days. To ignore this issue would in fact be to attach no weight at all to the requirement of disclosure in common law.\nI recognize that the concern regarding the issue of credibility is an important one, but save for exceptional circumstances, I share the opinion that failure to receive Port of Entry notes is generally not a satisfactory reason for not meeting the PIF deadline. In addition to the view expressed earlier that the receipt of the PIF within 28 days is a reasonable expectation, I am of the opinion that it is not unreasonable to expect the claimant to provide truthful information at every stage of the process. In preparing the PIF, the claimant is in the best position to know whether the information he has provided at the port of entry is consistent with what he is stating in his narrative. But even if this were not the case, the remedy for the potential problem raised by counsel is not, in my opinion, to delay the filing of the PIF. A timely request for the Port of Entry notes by counsel is the logical first expectation. Failing this and apart from the hearing at which the claimant is given the opportunity to address credibility-related issues (inconsistencies, contradictions, omissions, etc.), there is RPD Rule 6(4) which provides as follows:\n6.(4) If a claimant wants to change any information given in the Personal Information Form, the claimant must provide to the Division three copies of each page of the form to which changes have been made. The claimant must sign and date each new page and underline the change made. The subsection does not apply to a change in the choice of language for the proceeding or the language of interpretation.\nWhile the original PIF is subject to the 28-day rule, changes to the PIF are only subject to the disclosure of documents rule (RPD Rule 29(4)(a)).\nConsidering the above noted remedies, I am not persuaded by counsel's submission justifying an extension of the PIF time limit as it relates to the Port of Entry notes.\n7. Considerations regarding minor claimants\nCounsel's last argument concerns the sensitive issue of the abandonment of the claims of minor claimants in situations where they are associated with claims of their adult parents whose claims are in default. Counsel states, in part, as follows:\nWhere a claim involving minors is declared abandoned as result of the carelessness of the principal claimant in prosecuting the claim, it may result in a situation where minor claimants who are free from blame and would otherwise have a valid claim as a result of their parents [sic] well founded fear of persecution will find their claim also abandoned, only the principal claimant or claimants who have been in default pursuant to s.168 of IRPA should have their claims abandoned. If the minor children have in fact been free from blame with respect to prosecution of the claim, then natural justice would call for a new designated representative to be appointed who would serve in the best interest of the children, and the claim of the minor children ought to proceed.\nCounsel's concerns are being addressed, in part, by the RPD process to designate representatives for all minors at the outset of all proceedings, including the No PIF Abandonments, pursuant to RPD Rule 15. (A separate process exists for separated minors, who are beyond the scope of counsel's present submissions.) The RPD operates with the reasonable presumption that if a person is claiming protection from Canada, then that person is expected to be diligent in pursuing his or her claim. This expectation applies to claimants whose claims have been joined pursuant to RPD Rule 49, including the claims of children joined with the claims of their adult parents and on whose behalf one of the adults signs the minor claimant's PIF. In situations where the adult person is found to be an unsuitable designated representative, the RPD may designate a representative other than the parent.\nI assume that counsel is not calling for a \"re-designation\" of representatives in all abandonment situations, but only in instances where the adults do not appear to be acting in the best interests of their minor children. Such being my understanding, I take the liberty of bringing to counsel's attention the duty of counsel to notify the RPD, pursuant to RPD Rule 15(1) which states:\nIf counsel for a party believes that the Division should designate a representative for the minor claimant or protected person in the proceedings because the claimant or protected person is under 18 years of age or unable to appreciate the nature of the proceedings, counsel must without delay notify the Division in writing. If counsel is aware of a person in Canada who meets the requirements to be designated as a representative, counsel must provide the person's contact information in the notice.\nAlthough Subrule 15(2) states that 15(1) does not apply in the case of a claimant under 18 years of age whose claim is joined with the claim of a person who is 18 years of age or older, in my opinion RPD Rule 15(1) would become effective if counsel was of the opinion that the adult or adults with whose claims the minor claimants were joined but were unsuitable based on the criteria set out in Rule 15(3).\nCONCLUSION\nHaving rejected counsel's arguments 1 through 6, I do not find any compelling evidence before me to reasonably explain or justify the present claimants' failure to file their PIFs by the extended due date. This includes the delays the claimants experienced in their application for Legal Aid, already mentioned by counsel when he applied for and received an extension for the claimants from the original due date of 9 March 2003 to 30 March 2003. No additional explanation was proffered as to why the claimants' PIFs were received by the RPD only on 10 April 2003. In arriving at my decision, in addition to counsel's submissions, I have taken into account the facts that the claimants provided their PIFs before the No PIF Abandonment hearing and that they indicated that they were ready to continue with the proceedings for refugee protection. In the absence of any satisfactory explanation for the delay, I conclude that the claimants have not demonstrated the requisite diligence and therefore declare their claims to have been abandoned.\nI agree in principle with counsel's arguments on the last submission. However, having seen the parents and heard from the principal claimant, I do not find that he was an inappropriate person to be the designated representative for the two minor claimants. It is reasonable to conclude that the designated representative equated his own interests with that of the minor claimants, including hiring counsel, completing and providing their PIFs, albeit late, and instructing counsel. I am satisfied that the designated representative understood his role and cannot find that he failed to act in the best interests of the minor claimants.\nIn view of the foregoing analysis, I declare the claims of XXXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXX to have been abandoned.\n\"V.

He still owns land and a home in this area of Pakistan.\nIn 1990 the claimant moved to Islamabad and worked for the XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX. He lived in Rawalipindi from sometime in 1990 until he fled Pakistan in October 1997.\nIn XXXXX 1997 the claimant's brother was kidnapped by extreme militants fighting a Jihad with India in an attempt to reunite Kashmir. The claimant testified he has not spoken to his brother since 1997 and as of the day of the hearing has no knowledge of this brother's whereabouts.\nAfter the kidnapping of his brother the claimant made a series of visits to his home in Kashmir in an attempt to find information concerning his brother. During these visits the claimant spoke out against the actions of Jihadi organizations in forcing children and others to join their holy war with India.\nAs a result the claimant was attacked in XXXXX 1997 and again in XXXXX 1997. The first beating the claimant testified to resulted in medical attention: a report is found in Exhibit C-2. The second beating was less severe and required no medical attention.\nThe claimant continued to speak out against the practice of Jihad and as a result he received threats that he would be killed.\nFearing for his life, the claimant fled to the USA using his valid Pakistan passport and USA visitor visa.\nUpon entering the USA the claimant was given visitor status for approximately six months. This status expired in or around April 1998. The claimant and his sons lived in Chicago until he came to Canada in February 2003. His wife and daughter remained in Rawalipindi, Pakistan, throughout this period and are in Rawalipindi at the time of this hearing.\nThe claimant explained he cannot return to any part of Pakistan since he fears the Jihadi organizations will kill him.\nA few days before the hearing the claimant received information and supporting documents that there has been an outstanding arrest warrant against him since December 1997, and in fact he presented a police report that in December 1997 there had been an attempt to arrest the claimant in Rawalipindi but the police had been informed the claimant had left the country.\nThe claimant testified orally that he is convinced that the Jihadi organizations believe he, the claimant, is an agent of India and with the support of government agencies such as Inter Services Intelligence (ISI), the false charges were made against him.\nDETERMINATION\nI am satisfied that the claimant's actions after he left Pakistan in October 1997 and before he came to Canada February 2003 are not those of a person who fears for his life should he return to Pakistan. I reject the claim on the basis that the claimant has failed to discharge his burden of proof sufficient to establish a subjective basis for his fear.\nANALYSIS\nIs there a genuine arrest warrant and police report outstanding concerning the claimant's activities in Pakistan prior to his leaving in October 1997? I am satisfied this is not the case.\nThe claimant, when asked by his counsel as to how the documents in Exhibit C-2 concerning the warrant and police report got to Canada, responded that he (the claimant), after discussing his case with his current lawyer, called a friend in Pakistan. This friend went to the claimant's wife and the claimant's wife went to a lawyer who obtained the documents from the court. The wife then mailed the documents to the claimant in Canada.\nWhen the Refugee Protection Officer (RPO) first questioned on this point the claimant explained that he contacted a friend who went to the lawyer, got the documents and gave them to the wife, who sent them to Canada. When the RPO attempted to clarify what really happened that resulted in the documents being in evidence, the claimant then testified that he contacted his wife who contacted the friend.\nWhen these inconsistencies were put to the claimant he assured the panel that he had contacted his wife and that he knew he had made a mistake when he first testified in chief that he contacted a friend, but because his counsel went on and asked the next question the claimant had no chance to correct his mistake.\nI do not accept this explanation. I accept the claimant's knowledge as to exactly what was the sequence of events in Pakistan that resulted in the document being in Canada would be at best indirect and I make no negative inference that testimony in this area was not perfect. However the claimant's knowledge as to whom he contacted to check to see if he was wanted is first hand. He made the call to someone and, on a balance of probabilities, this area should have been consistent. It was not.\nThe second credibility concern I have with these documents is the plausibility that they have existed since December 1997. An attempt was made by the police to arrest the claimant in December 1997 and yet the testimony is that neither the claimant nor his wife had any knowledge of their existence until sometime just before the hearing. On a balance of probabilities, if the police made an attempt to arrest the claimant in December 1997, the claimant's wife would have been the person spoken to by the police.\nI do not accept the explanation, provided in evidence of that, the police spoke to persons watching the house and find, on a balance of probabilities, that if the documents are genuine and if the police attempted to arrest the claimant in December 1997, the claimant's wife would have been the person contacted by the police and the claimant's wife would have known of the existence of these documents.\nConsidering the ease with which false documents of this nature can be obtained in Pakistan (Exhibit R-1, item 3.2), the inconsistency as to whom the claimant contacted to check the courts, and the implausibility that the claimant's wife would not know of the attempt to arrest the claimant until early spring of 2003, I find these documents do not support on their own that there is an arrest warrant outstanding concerning the claimant's actions prior to leaving Pakistan. In the absence of other reliable supporting evidence I find, on a balance of probabilities, there are no outstanding arrest warrants or FIR reports.\nWere the claimant's actions between October 1997 and February 2003 those of a person who feared returning or being returned to Pakistan? I am satisfied they are not.\nDuring the period October 1997 to April 1998 the claimant was in the USA legally as a result of his USA visitor visa and the card issued on entry valid for six months.\nThe claimant testified that prior to April 1998 he did visit a lawyer who informed the claimant not to make a claim for asylum since there is no guarantee he would be successful. If the claim failed the claimant would be sent back to Pakistan. As I pointed out during the hearing, no lawyer including the counsel present today can guarantee success. I also pointed out that once he no longer had legal status in the USA there were many ways he could come to the attention of the US authorities. The one example I gave was a simple speeding ticket.\nThe claimant, when asked if people were being deported, replied he had not seen them personally but had read that many people were being deported. When questioned by the RPO the claimant remembered the lawyer telling him he could stay the same way as 100,000 others stay, but the claimant could not recall the lawyer's name.\nThe RPO asked if the claimant had made other efforts to gain legal status in any other country. He replied he had not since he had so many friends without status. At one point the claimant testified he thought the situation might improve in Pakistan.\nI asked the claimant specifically when he was in the USA illegally and if he was afraid the US authorities might deport him to Pakistan, why did he not come to Canada or the UK or some other country then and make a claim at that time. He replied he was living peacefully and had a good life. I pointed out I did not know how that could be the case since the claimant had assured me he still loved his wife and wanted to reunite the family, and yet at the time referenced part of his family was in Pakistan while he was in the USA.\nAt the end of the hearing I pointed out that even if I was to set aside my concerns surrounding the events that happened in Pakistan prior to his leaving, including the fact that he suffered at most threatening phone calls when he lived in Rawalipindi and had not experienced serious incidents for more than six years, I would still be faced with the question as to whether his actions in the USA from October 1997 to February 2003 were consistent with those of a person who feared returning to Pakistan.\nI listed my concerns:\n* he made no claim for asylum when his legal status ended;\n* he made no attempt to seek the protection of another country until after living for five years illegally afraid of deportation;\n* he did not attempt to reunite his family when his wife and daughter were in Pakistan and he and his sons in the USA;\n* he renewed his Pakistani passport shortly before coming to Canada, yet according to his testimony in 1998 he feared for his life if returned to Pakistan and at the hearing expressed the same fear and feared arrest by the authorities of that country.\nThe claimant explained he had stayed in the US under the impression things might improve or there might be a general amnesty. I disclosed my specialized knowledge that I was aware of the rumour of an amnesty towards the end of the Clinton first term or the early part of the Clinton second term, but those rumours ended as the election approached and there have certainly been no such rumours during the Bush administration.\nThe claimant in his explanation included he may have been misguided but that he has come here to Canada to reunite his family.\nI do not accept this explanation. The claimant had an obvious way to unite his family; that was to make a claim in the USA in early 1998 or to come to Canada or another country and make a claim at that time. He did not do either of these.\nCOUNSEL'S SUBMISSIONS\nPost hearing counsel provided written submissions (Exhibit C-4).\nOn page 2, counsel submits there are two outstanding issues - credibility and delay. I agree credibility is always an issue and I have found in one specific area the claimant's evidence to be not credible. I agree with counsel delay is an issue in this claim but it is not the simple issue of failing to leave Pakistan soon after the final incident or failing to make a refugee claim in Canada for a few weeks.\nIn this case there are many aspects of the claimant's delay. My analysis focuses on the accumulative effect these factors have on the believability of the claimant's stated fear. These include:\n1. The nature of the harm feared.\nIn the case before me the claimant's testimony is he fears serious harm including a fear he will be killed if he returns to Pakistan. His actions I then evaluate against this most severe harm feared.\n2. The length of the delay.\nThe facts before me support this is more than a period where the claimant was in transit. The entire length is from the fall of 1997 until early 2003 more than five years in total. I accept that for the first six months the claimant had visitor status in the USA however even so that leaves some four a half years when the claimant was without legal status in any country outside of Pakistan. In this case the length of the delay becomes an important factor in the analysis.\n3. The efforts made by the claimant to legalize his status.\nThe claimant made an attempt to seek legal advice in 1997. He then waited until he had been in the USA for more than six month illegally before seeking a second legal opinion. Rather than seek the protection of the USA's refugee system, the claimant relied on the advice of friends and acquaintances. During this illegal period, April 1998 until early 2003, the claimant had no protection from removal by US authorities. I note in the words of the claimant, he was living a good life during this period.\n4. The reasonableness of the explanations offered.\nThe claimant offered a number of explanations for his actions which he summed up by his statement that he may have been misguided. Even if I accept this explanation on its face I am still left with the evidence that the claimant accepted this misguided advice. He did not exercise any of the options available. Options that would have protected him from removal until his case had been determined, whether in the USA or in Canada.\nInstead the claimant chose the option of living in the US illegally while hoping the situation in his country of origin might improve.\nAs a result the excessive delay involved and the fact he allegedly feared extreme harm if returned to his home country of reference, the panel does not accept the claimant's explanations as reasonable and adequate to explain the failure to attempt to seek protection or to legalize his status outside his country of reference. The panel finds that the length of the delay and the absence of a reasonable explanation undermine the claimant's assertions of a fear of returning to Pakistan and as a result undermine his claim for refugee protection.\nAs a result, the panel finds the claimant did not discharge his burden of proof sufficient to establish the subjective basis of his claim.\nCounsel in his submissions refers to a number of reports of sectarian violence in Pakistan. The issue of state protection for religious minorities is not an issue in this claim since this claim is based on perceived political opinion.\nEven after a careful review of counsel's submissions I am not persuaded that the claimant has met the burden of proof sufficient to establish that his actions are those of a person with a well-founded subjective fear of being returned to Pakistan.\nCONCLUSION\nA claimant must support his claim with credible and trustworthy evidence sufficient to satisfy both the subjective and objective component of a well-founded fear. In this case the subjective component, on a balance of probabilities, has not been established.1 Hence the claim is rejected on that basis pursuant to section 96 and\/or section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\"Cliff Berry\"\nCliff Berry\nDATED at Toronto this 7th day of July, 2003.\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - DELAY - SUBJECTIVE ELEMENT - CREDIBILITY - MALE - NEGATIVE - PAKISTAN\n1 Cruz, Fernando Rodriguez v.

He fears persecution at the hands of drug dealers whom he reported to the police in Costa Rica. He claims protection as a person who faces a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Costa Rica.\nJurisprudential Guidelines\nThe Chairperson has the authority under s. 159(1)(h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act1 to identify decisions of the Board as jurisprudential guides to assist members in carrying out their duties. The Board's Policy on the Use of Jurisprudential Guides is available on the Board's website.2 Effective May 15, 2003, the Chairperson identified two decisions of the Refugee Protection Division as jurisprudential guides.3 Members are to consider and follow these decisions when determining claims in which the availability of state protection in Costa Rica is the determinative issue in claim profiles of risk due to sexual orientation or general criminality.4\nI determine that TA2-14980 applies in this case.\nI determine that the facts and the evidence regarding country conditions in this claim are sufficiently close to those before the panel in TA2-14980. In addition, I assessed the April 2003 RPD Information Package, which was not before the Jurisprudential Guide panel. In reaching my decision, I have assessed the claimant's own experiences in the context of the entirety of the evidence.\nAllegations\nThe claimant alleges as follows: In XXXX 2003 he reported the activity of drug dealers in his neighbourhood to the police and a few days later he began receiving death threats by way of hand delivered notes. He was subsequently attacked and seriously injured by 3 men wearing masks and his wife was harassed and threatened by an unknown individual, so she fled to Nicaragua for safety. The claimant went into hiding but the perpetrators found him and asked for him at the home of his stepfather. He fled Costa Rica for protection in Canada on XXXXX, 2003.\nAnalysis\nThe claimant's identity as a national of Costa Rica is established by a certified true copy of his passport5 submitted by Citizenship and Immigration Canada as well as his testimony.\nThe availability of state protection for this claimant is the determinative issue in this claim. The availability of state protection in Costa Rica has been comprehensively analysed in TA2-14980. That reasoning applies to the facts of this claim. As a result, I adopt the reasoning in TA2-14980.\nThe documentary evidence reveals that the Costa Rican government is making serious efforts to protect people who are victims of crime. Furthermore, there are a number of recourses available in Costa Rica for the assessment, prosecution, and the granting of remedies resulting from the failure of the law enforcement agencies to conduct their work.\nI accept that the claimant was threatened and that he feared drug dealers. However, I find that state protection was available to him in Costa Rica. I find from the claimant's testimony that the authorities were making serious efforts to protect him and I do not have any evidence before me which indicates otherwise. For example, the claimant testified that after the initial report he made to the rural police in XXXX about the drug dealers he reported the subsequent assault to the police in XXXX and made a final report to the police in XXXXXXXX. He testified that on each occasion he went to the police a written report was made and he was told that an investigation would follow. He was also advised each time he went to the police that, in addition to their investigation, it would be helpful for him to try to get witnesses and further evidence in support of his case.\nWhen asked if his wife could act as a witness, he said they were too afraid to allow her to do that. When asked if his stepfather could be a witness, he said he didn't want him to have problems. When asked if he gave the handwritten threatening notes to the police, he said he didn't think of it. The claimant stated he was afraid to provide any evidence to support his case, yet at the same time, he made police reports in the first place. I therefore find that the claimant was not serious about the reports he made. I find that if the claimant was serious about reporting the drug dealers to the authorities and if he expected a concrete outcome, then he should have been prepared to follow up with some evidence. The claimant himself stated that without evidence there was nothing the police could do to help him. I find that the authorities were given extremely limited information by the claimant, as he did not provide them with any witnesses or any other evidence to support his case.\nThe claimant said that he knew the police did not go to his neighborhood to investigate because he did not see them there. I find that just because the claimant did not see the police, does not mean they did not go to the neighborhood to investigate. I find there is no evidence before to support that conclusion. I find that it is likely that the authorities did investigate the claimant's complaints, yet were not able to apprehend the perpetrators. I find that if the authorities did not apprehend the perpetrators that this does not indicate that there was no investigation, as concluded by the claimant.\nThe documentary evidence reveals that Costa Rican authorities are making serious efforts in investigating and combating counter narcotics offenses.6 The more democratic the state's institutions, the more the claimant must have done to exhaust all the courses open to him.7 I find that if the claimant was not satisfied with the police handling of the matter that he had recourse to other authorities in Costa Rica. For example, the claimant stated that he was not aware of the Office of the Ombudsman, but after I explained its purpose, the claimant stated that he could make a complaint to that office if he returned to Costa Rica. I find that the appropriate course of action taken by a reasonable person would have been to pursue his case through the available authorities, rather than assuming that the process was flawed and take the extreme measure of leaving the country.\nI considered that Costa Rica8 is a longstanding, stable, constitutional democracy with an independent judiciary providing effective means to deal with individual cases of abuse. In the context of the country of origin, and in the circumstances of this claimant in particular, I find that the claimant has not taken all reasonable steps to seek protection in Costa Rica. Therefore, I find that he has not discharged the onus of showing clear and convincing proof of the state's inability or unwillingness to protect him.\nGiven that there is state protection for this claimant in Costa Rica, I find that there is not a serious possibility that the claimant would face persecution, a risk to his life, a danger of torture, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment should he return to Costa Rica.\nAccordingly, the RPD finds that XXXXXXXXXXXX is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection and rejects his claim.\n\"M.

She claims to be a person in need of refugee protection because of political opinion and membership in a particular social group.1 The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration seeks to exclude the claimant from refugee protection.\nThe Federal Court of Appeal states in the Maldonado2 decision that when a claimant swears to the truthfulness of his or her evidence, a presumption exists that that evidence is true unless there is a good reason to conclude otherwise.\nThe Federal Court of Appeal has given further direction to the CRDD (now RPD) in Rajaratnam3 in which its states:\nA refugee claimant is not, therefore, absolved of the duty of telling the truth. The tribunal hearing his evidence is entitled to disbelieve him and to base its decision on that assessment, but is required to give reasons for a finding of lack of credibility in 'clear and unmistakable terms.'\nIn the decision of Shahamati,4 the Federal Court of Appeal states:\nContrary to what has sometimes been said the Board is entitled, in assessing credibility, to rely on such criteria as rationality and common sense.\nFor the reasons set out, I find the claimant was not credible.\nThe claimant's story is complex. Her narrative statement is 14 pages long and contains 48 paragraphs. Her alleged problems arise from her position as an accountant with a government agency in China.\nThe claimant is 52 years old, having been born on XXXX 1950 in Guangdong Province, China. She has one daughter, XXXXXXXXXX, living in Canada, and is divorced from her former husband, XXXXXXXXX. The claimant has 12 years of education and has a diploma in XXXXXXXX. She last worked for the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXX XXXXX XXXXXXXXXX XXXXXX XXXXXXX XXXXX XXXXXXXXXX). She describes that type of work she did in her Personal Information Form (PIF)5 as \"Administration\/Management.\"6\nThe claimant has traveled extensively in the five years leading up to her refugee claim. She has been in Denmark, Germany, Holland, Belgium, Seychelles, France, Morocco Australia, and New Zealand. In addition, she visited her daughter in Canada in XXXX 1998 and early 1999. She left China for the last time in XXXXX of 1999, \"in transit\" via Thailand, Venezuela, Columbia, and Brazil on her way to Canada. Her \"in transit\" stay in Venezuela totaled 19 months.7 She claimed to be a Convention refugee immediately upon arrival in Canada on 30 March 2001.\nThe claimant begins her PIF with some historical background information about her life. She states that she and her family suffered during the Cultural Revolution, because her father was considered a member of the \"Black Seven.\" Despite the hardships imposed on her she was able to eventually obtain an education and find employment.\nAccording to her PIF, in 1989 she became responsible for compiling the financial reports of all XXXX XXXXX XXXX and managing the financial information for XXXXX. In 1989 she also became qualified as an XXXXX. In XXXXX 1992 she was promoted to the position of XXXX XXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXX XXXXXX in Guangzhou. She was the only official in her level of responsibility not a member of the Communist Party. Her responsibilities included XXXXX XXXXXX XXXXX.\" She had no responsibility for day to day XXXXX issues. Her duties included the initial approval of XXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX XXXXXX, initial approval of XXXXXXXX XXXXXXX XXXXX XXXXXXX and initial approval of XXXXXXX to XXXXXX from the XXXXXXXXX of the city of Guangzhou.\nAccording to her PIF, as a result of a re-organization in XXXX 1996, the claimant became one of two XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXX for the XXXXXXXX. Her superior, the XXXXX XXXXX, stated that the claimant was responsible for managing all the XXXXX aspects of the XXXX Division. The claimant states in her PIF:\nI was, therefore, the only XXXXXXX with respect to XXXXXXX dealing with outside agencies and was the only person with XXXXXXXX for that purpose. I was responsible for the XXXXXXXX of the XXXXXXXXXXXX of the XXXXXXXXXXX within the XXXXX XXXXXX XXXXXXX XXXXX. With this work I had to XXXX and XXXXX with my XXXXX the XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX for XXXXX that had been XXXXXXX. Once the companies received my XXXXX on their forms the companies would then be able to submit their applications for their XXXXXX to the XXXX XXXXX XXXXXX XXXXX XXX XXXXXX XXXXXXX XXXX.8\nHer income in this position appears to have been quite modest.9\nAt her hearing the claimant stated that she never joined the Communist Party because she did not like it. She got her position because she was the only person available with her set of skills.\nIn her PIF the claimant alleges her problems arose after XXXX 1996 because she came into conflict with her leaders when she disobeyed orders they were giving her.\nAccording to her PIF narrative, in late 1996 or early 1997 the claimant was asked to attend a meeting with her Director, XXXXXXXX, and the general manager of a company called the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, Guangzhou. The general manager, Mr. XXX, stated that the \"USA suspected that his company was dumping its commodities in the United States, and that the USA was going to send an investigation group to investigate the export commodities of his corporation.\"10 Mr. XXX told the claimant that an official from another organization, the XXXX XXXXXXX, Mr. XXXXXXX, had already refused to produce fraudulent documentation that would have solved the problem. Why the claimant would be informed of this was not clear. There was no reason she needed to know this as it was an admission by Mr. XXX, a stranger to her, of wrongdoing.\nAccording to her PIF, XXXXXXXX ordered the claimant to produce a fraudulent export refund certificate, one of the documents needed by the company to deal with the US audit. The claimant refused to produce the certificate, saying it \"was not proper to do that kind of thing\".11 Mr. XXXX told the claimant two more times to produce the certificate, but she refused. Her relationship with Mr. XXXXX began to deteriorate after this incident. The claimant states he no longer trusted her.\nAt her hearing she stated that after this incident her boss began to berate her at meetings and gave her a disproportionate amount of work to do. She stated there was no point in complaining about him because he was a person of high authority with a great number of connections within the government. It was beyond a person in her station in life to complain about a person such as him.\nAccording to her statement, in late 1997 or early 1998, the claimant's counterpart, XXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX, told her that a XXXXXXXX Investigation Group was coming to Guangzhou to investigate if a XXXXXXXX was \"exhibiting dumping behavior.\"12 The claimant alleges that the company had been exempt for taxes on profits and VAT for three years:\n...due to under the table arrangements with Guangzhou Revenue. The Guangzhou government improperly defers VAT tax levies for periods of time without the central government explicitly knowing about it.\"\nThe claimant was asked by XXXXXXX, XXXXXXXX of XXXXX and her counterpart in the organization, to make up a fraudulent VAT certificate, but the claimant refused. Her refusal offended Mr. XXX. At her hearing, the claimant stated that she was told that Mr. XXXXXXXX of the XXXXXXXXX had been contacted and had again refused to issue a fake tax rebate.\nAt the hearing the claimant asked if there were any repercussions for Mr. XXXXX as a result of his refusal to produce fraudulent documents. She replied that he had been demoted to head of the XXXXXXX where he worked, but she could not say this had happened specifically because of his refusal to do as he was asked.\nMs. XXXX was asked why she was asked to produce fraudulent documents a second time, given that she had refused once before. She replied that perhaps her bosses wanted to try again through the medium of a person of equal rank to her. She also stated that she was not sure if Mr. XXXXXXXXXXX knew of her first refusal. Ms. XXXX speculation is not evidence of fact. It is difficult to understand why information about a proposed fraud was provided to Ms. XXX a second time, given her refusal to cooperate before. This is all the more difficult to comprehend given the fact that she was, by her own words, no longer trusted by her superior.\nAccording to her PIF, in the end the US and XXXXXXXX investigators did not discover anything amiss. However, because she was suspicious, the claimant secretly investigated the situation. She found out that in the US investigation, XXXXXXX issued the necessary export refund certificate despite the fact that it had no authority to do so. In the other matter, XXXXX told the XXXXXX investigation team that another enterprise was responsible for making the export refunds for the XXXXX company. The XXXXXXX investigators were fooled by these lies.\nThe claimant stated at her hearing that she became curious as to how the matter was resolved. She asked XXXXXXX what then had happened. Mr. XXXX explained to her how the ruse had been carried out. The claimant was impressed by the way the matter had been handled, even if she would never indulge in such conduct herself. It is difficult to understand why Mr. XXXX divulged this information to the claimant, given that she had twice refused to go along with the production of false documents and was mistrusted. The claimant went on to discuss what she found out about the US investigation team. They too were satisfied with documents issued by persons not entitled to produce them. The claimant got this information from another source who had no reticence in filling her in.\nThe claimant was asked what she did with the information she obtained. She replied she recorded it in a large notebook. The claimant recorded an eclectic variety of information in her notebook. Along with her notes of the fraudulent activities of her superiors and others she kept meeting records and other miscellaneous information in the book. She recorded in it her thoughts on economic reforms and reform in foreign trade matters. She stated that the book allowed her to look at things in a structural manner and think systematically. She had formed the habit of keeping such a book early in her working life.\nThe next incident the claimant complains of in her PIF occurred in XXXXX 1999. XXXXX sent the claimant a form from XXXXXXXXXXXX, which purported to remove and transfer its department of finance manager, Ms. XXXXXXXXXXX. The claimant found out that Ms. XXXXX was being removed because she refused to obey the XXXXX of the board of her company. He wanted her to conceal the amount of profits made by the company and the taxes that were due. According to the claimant,13\nXXXXXXXXXXX removal had to be first approved by the upper level department (me) and then by the XXXX personnel department. That meant that in order for Ms. XXXXX removal to become effective, I would have had to sign it. Of course, I did not agree to sign the report.\nMs. XXXX was transferred in any event. The claimant found out that it had been ordered by \"...the higher up authorities...\".14 The claimant allegedly complained to the head of XXXX, Mr. XXXXXXXXXXX, about what had happened, and told him she was going to report the matter to the \"Financial Bureau.\" According to the claimant:15\nXXXXXXX threatened me, saying: \"If you antagonize me, you will not have a good result.\" By saying this XXXXXXX meant that he would take immediate measures against me. If I had reported the matter it would have been very difficult for me. I had already made it clear that I opposed this type of corruption and improper conduct. If I did anything more I would have been in extreme danger.\nThe claimant sets out another incident in her PIF. In early 1999, a private Hong Kong company called XXXXXXX Company was supervised by XXXX. The company was in debt and losing money. The rumor was that the Deputy Manager of the company, Ms. XXXXXXXX, was embezzling funds. In XXXXX or XXXXX of 1999, XXXXXXX told the claimant he wanted to state that the Hong Kong company was running a serious deficit because the Deputy Manager of the company was improperly relying on a line of credit. The Deputy Manager's signing rights were to be transferred to the claimant. The claimant obtained accounting information from the company and found out that its problems were not due to the Deputy Manager but to the \"stopping of the business\" by XXXXXXXXX.16\nAt her hearing the claimant stated that she undertook the assignment without hesitation as it was the type of thing she did for XXXX. She had no suspicion that anything was amiss. That XXXX assigned her to controversial financial matters at this point in her career is difficult to understand, given Mr. XXXX attitude towards her. It is also more difficult to understand her apparent artlessness in agreeing to take on such a task without question.\nAt the hearing the claimant added that Mr. XXXX offered her a number of financial incentives to produce a report blaming Ms. XXX for the company's problems and implying that Ms. XXX was guilty of embezzlement. Why Mr. XXXX thought he could sway the claimant in this manner, given her previous refusals to indulge in falsehood, is not clear.\nThe claimant was asked by Mr. XXXX to compile a report falsely stating that the Managing Director of the company was corrupt and had run the company in a poor fashion. The claimant felt that Mr. XXXX motivation for getting rid of the Managing Director was to damage the reputation of a previous Managing Director Mr. XXXX did not like. The claimant's PIF implies that if not for Mr. XXXX interference, the company could have continued on as it was otherwise a viable business. The claimant states in her PIF that if she wrote the truth in her report, the intentions of Mr. XXXX would be exposed. If she did what Mr. XXXX wanted her to do, the current Managing Director would suffer unjustly. At first the claimant made up excuses for not going to Hong Kong to compile a report. Finally she simply refused to go. Mr. XXXX then told her to write her report based on the information she had on hand. Mr. XXXX made it clear that the report was to implicate the Managing Director. When the claimant refused to do his bidding, Mr. XXXX threatened her. \"He said that if I continue to disobey him, thereby making things worse for him and making him lose face, it would be turned against me.\"17 In any event, the Managing Director of the Hong Kong company resigned.\nAt the hearing the claimant stated that she had a heated exchange with Mr. XXXX when he asked her to write a report based on the information she had collected without actually going to Hong Kong. He allegedly said to her:\nYou have been holding an offensive stance against me all the time. You have not only spoiled all my arrangement, you have also made me lose face in front of the enterprises and also the commission. Who know when will be your turn?18\nShe goes on to state that she regarded this as the first confrontation between herself and Mr. XXXX. The earlier interactions were more subtle and emotional incidents. This statement is not credible, since the claimant said Mr. XXXX began publicity rebuking her some time before.\nAt the hearing the claimant stated that she did not know whether Ms. XXX had or had not committed embezzlement. She could not reach a conclusion without doing an investigation, and she could not do an investigation on the terms set out by Mr. XXXX.\nAccording to her PIF, in XXXX 1999, the claimant's daughter \"applied for me to immigrate to Canada.\"19 The claimant agreed to immigrate because she did not want to work in China anymore. Other documents filed by Canada Immigration state that sponsorship of the claimant was initiated in June of 1999.20 The claimant was in Canada in February and March 1999. She alleges in her PIF that she applied for a visitor's visa to Canada on XXXXX 1999 and was told she would be interviewed that afternoon.\nThere is a cryptic entry in the materials from the Canadian visa office in Hong Kong regarding the XXXXXX application:21 \"Recd poise pen fax for appln, ...subj withdrew case today as she would have to fly for Thailand today at 4:30 p.m.\" The import of this entry was not elaborated on in the evidence presented by the claimant or the Minister's Representative. However, it does suggest that the claimant withdrew her application for reasons other than those stated in her PIF.\nA reference is also made in the materials to a deposit in the name of the claimant's daughter for \"XXXXX\" in an application by the claimant's former husband for a Canadian visitor's visa in XXXXX of 1999.\nReturning to the claimant's PIF, in XXXX of 1999 three people from the Procurator's Office came to XXXX and began checking the accounting books. The claimant became suspicious when she got word 'from a friend of a friend' working in the Procurator's Office that the investigation was prompted by an anonymous letter that contained no proof. On the afternoon of the day in question, a person with the Procurator's Office, Mr. XXX, brought an account record of XXXXX RMB and asked the claimant what it was for. The claimant responded that she did not know because she was not the person responsible for the specific work. Mr. XXX became angry and interrogated the claimant for two hours. The next day, a staff person at XXXX informed the claimant that the Procurator's Office had checked all the accounting records. The only anomaly they found was that a term deposit for XX million RMB had been taken out early and a penalty had been imposed. The staff person agreed with the claimant that the matter had already been properly reported and explained. However, the staff person told the claimant to be careful because \"he felt\" the Procurator's Office wanted to frame the claimant.22\nIn her oral testimony, she stated that the investigators from the Procurators office had some concerns about a XXXXX RMB23 term deposit. When she was questioned about the amount by them, she did not put on her glasses to read the paperwork presented to her. She stated at the hearing that she thought the amount referred to was XXXX RMB and thought to herself \"Hey, such a small amount, what the big deal?\"24 She told the investigators that if they wanted to know about the background on this deposit they should speak to Mr. XXXXXX, her subordinate. The confrontation allegedly went on for a further two hours in a standoff. After the meeting she found out they were asking her about a sum 10 times greater. She maintained at the hearing that there was an explanation for the handling of this amount of money that would have satisfied the investigators. However, as will be seen later, she took no steps to provide that explanation herself. I find it implausible that the claimant would not bother to put on her glasses so that she could read the paperwork put in front of her by the Procuratorate's inspectors as part of a two hour meeting. She appeared to be treating an obviously serious matter in an off-hand manner.\nThe claimant was asked at the hearing if the Procurator initiates investigations on its own without prior contact with the Public Security Bureau. She replied that this could occur.\nAccording to her PIF, the claimant went to work as usual on XXXX 1999. As she approached Mr. XXXX door to deliver some documents, she overheard him say on the telephone \"'Shuang Gui' her first!\" The claimant assumed this comment referred to her and took it to mean that, \"...I would be in extreme trouble because I could be imprisoned indefinitely and forced to falsely confess to things I did not do. I gave the documents I had to XXXX XXXX XXXX and left.\"25 The claimant knew something was wrong and immediately left work. A coworker, \"Mr. XXXX,\" called her, wanting to know where she was. She replied that she was ill and needed to see a doctor. He told her he would cover for her and also told her the Procurator's office was asking for her. The claimant went first to Shen Zhen and then Hong Kong. While in Hong Kong she called Mr. XXXX who asked where she was in a \"stern\" manner. He told her the Procurator was looking for her. It was clear to the claimant that he was speaking in front of other people.\nAt her hearing, the claimant's recollection of Mr. XXXX statement was different. She stated she heard him say, \"if that could not be achieved, then - probably by then we would use the double regulation to punish her.\"26 At her hearing, she stated that the 'double regulation punishment' is the worst kind of situation to be in.\nThe claimant also confirmed for the Minister's Representative that after she overheard Mr. XXXX statement, she fled. She agreed she did not go to the investigators and ask what she could do to clear things up nor did she tell her boss or anyone else that she was leaving. However, according to her earlier evidence, she had information that would have allayed the concerns of the investigators, at least in regard to the issue of the handling of the XXXX RMB transaction they originally questioned her about. In my view, her flight could only increase any suspicions the authorities might have about the claimant's conduct.\nIt just so happened that the claimant had a visa to visit a relative in Thailand at this crucial time. According to the partial photocopy of her passport, she obtained the visa on XXXXX 1999. The visa was valid for three months. She immediately bought an airline ticket for Thailand. While in Hong Kong a friend told her he could get her a visa to travel to Venezuela in about two days time. The claimant considered going to the Canadian Consulate to apply for a visa before going to Venezuela. She states that she did not believe that she had enough time to apply for a Venezuelan visa if the Canadian visa was denied. As a result she applied for a Venezuelan visa which she obtained on XXXX 1999. That same day she decided to apply for a Canadian visa after all. The claimant knew that if she went to Canada she would never want to leave. This fact would force her to lie to the Canadian authorities when she applied for her visa. She decided that she could not do this, as it might hurt her husband's chances to get immigrate to Canada as she and he had planned to do. Even though she was separated from her husband, it was \"...vitally important to me not to ruin his chances of coming to Canada.\"27 Rather than do this, she decided to not pursue the Canadian visa. As noted earlier, there is an indication in the materials that she had other reasons for withdrawing her application.\nThe claimant traveled from Thailand to Venezuela on X XXXX 1999. She was asked at her hearing why she moved on from Thailand to Venezuela. She did not answer the question, but repeated the evidence in her PIF about the timing of her application in Hong Kong for a Canadian visitor's visa. In the end, it is not clear why she left for Venezuela.\nOnce in Venezuela, she contacted friends who contacted \"Mr. XXXX.\" Through this circuitous route she found out that her office had been searched. Among the things seized was the notebook of the claimant's. This notebook contained:\n* Her notes of her investigation into the wrongdoing described in her PIF narrative\n* The essence of the claimant's thoughts on the failure of Chinese economic reform which she kept in order to write articles on the topic\n* The claimant's views on the power struggles between some of her leaders\n* Notes on Guangzhou and China's involvement with foreign trade\n* Notes on China's illegal conduct in regard to the World Trade Organization (WTO).\nThe claimant states in her PIF that the information was very detailed and well organized and the information in it could cause great damage to China. She states, \"If I had not been so scared and in such a rush I would have retrieved my notebook and brought it but I did not manage to get it before leaving.\"28 The claimant was asked at the hearing who would be in trouble if the Procurator discovered her notebook. She replied that she and all the parties mentioned in the book would be in trouble. As well, the Guangzhou \"team government\" would be in trouble. The claimant was asked why she would leave the book behind, given its importance. She replied that she was nervous and worked up. The only thought in her mind was to leave. Later in the hearing she said it did not enter her mind to remove the notebook. She had not done anything wrong and had nothing to fear. However, the claimant knew on the XX, X and XX of XXX that she was under investigation. She attended her office each day. She had ample time to retrieve the notebook. I find it beyond rationality and common sense that she would leave it behind in the manner she alleges.\nAccording to her PIF, the claimant did not apply for a visa to come to Canada in Venezuela because she thought, incorrectly, that she needed to be a Venezuelan resident to apply. Her concern about lying to Canadian authorities as to her motives seems to have been overcome, in that her evidence suggests that had she thought she was able to apply for a Canadian visa she would have done so. In her PIF she states that she was in transit in Venezuela. In her oral evidence, as described later in these reasons, she states she was in the process of applying for residency in Venezuela. The two characterizations of her intentions vis-a-vis Venezuela are inconsistent and her evidence in this area is not credible.\nShe alleges in her PIF that in XXXXX of 2000 she was contacted by two police officers in Venezuela. They told her they had orders to arrest her for China. However, they said they would not arrest her if she paid them a bribe. The claimant thought the Chinese authorities had tracked her down through Interpol and by listening in on telephone conversations between her and her daughter. It is unclear how the Chinese government would be able to listen into phone calls between Venezuela and Canada. The panel can give no weight to this speculation.\nThe claimant feared that the Chinese Ministry of Public Security used gangs to arrest people who are outside China. In early XXXXX 2001, the claimant heard that a member of a local Chinese gang faction in Venezuela was looking for her. The claimant decided she had to escape. According to her, \"All my hopes were dashed to pieces.\"29 It is not clear what those hopes were. When people allegedly began asking for the claimant at different places, the claimant decided to leave.\nAfter giving a great deal of detail in her PIF as to her travels from China, the claimant ends her description of her trip to Canada with almost no detail. She states, \"I managed to contact a smuggling agent I got a false passport and left for Canada.\"30 At her hearing she stated she traveled from Venezuela to Canada on a fraudulent passport. She had a valid Chinese passport, but she left it behind in Venezuela. When asked where it was in Venezuela the claimant stated she left the passport with the friend in an attempt to arrange for residency. The following exchange took place between the claimant and her counsel:31\nQ Does your friend still have the passport?\nA I suppose yes, but I have not been - I have not been in contact with her.\nQ Why not?\nA Because to me this passport is of no further use.\nThe claimant did provide to the panel a partial photocopy of what she alleges is her valid passport. Several pages of the original passport appear to be missing from the copy. It is not clear why the claimant does not have her Chinese passport with her in Canada or why she did not present the original to the panel. It is a truism that a passport is a primary identification document. The original and complete version would be extremely useful for determining if the document had ever been renewed32 and for confirming the claimant's travel history. Her explanation that the passport is of no further use is incorrect and not credible. Her presentation of a partial photocopy is problematic.\nIn her PIF, the claimant sets out her view as to why she is being sought by the government of China.33\nI am being sought by the Chinese government because I refused to follow the illegal and shameful orders of my leaders in XXXX and because they know that I have been maintaining detailed information that is very critical of China's international trade practices. As a result of my refusing to act in the illegal fashion my leaders wanted me to, I caused them to lose face. My leaders know that because of my position of responsibility I know too much information and they do not want to let me remain free. They believe that it is necessary to keep me quiet by putting me in prison by fabricating charges against me. They also want to retaliate against me for my refusal to support them in their aims. I believe that my leaders' actions in covering up China's violations of international trade are motivated by a desire to help China at any cost.\nThe claimant's PIF continues on in a rambling manner to the effect that she was being sought by her superiors because she was not a member of the Communist Party, and was not subject to its internal discipline. This was \"a very severe infraction.\" It is not clear to what the claimant is referring. She also suggests her superiors might be against her because she has contact with outsiders such as her daughter in Canada. By this means she can reveal secrets to the outside world.\nThe claimant states in her PIF:34\nWhile the authorities were interrogating XXXXX XXXX [a good friend of the claimant's] the authorities apparently even then accused me of taking large amounts of money and fleeing.\nSince the claimant left China, the claimant alleges the authorities have frozen her daughter's bank account in Hong Kong. Her husband has divorced her and his passport has been taken from him. As well, the claimant's home has been seized by XXXX despite the fact that the organization has no right to do so.\nClaimant's counsel asked her how much money she had in China. She replied that she would be considered rich. At their peak, her and her husband's assets were worth was about XX million RMB.35 She stated that they made their money through endeavors such as her husband's business, a Chinese XXXXXXXXX retail outlet run by her husband, trading in XXXXXX, and her own trading in foreign exchange. She bought and sold RMB and Hong Kong dollars. She also invested in high interest bank accounts. The claimant's profit was XXX million RMB, which she made from 1993 until 1997. This was her share of the family fortune.\nAfter the close of the hearing counsel for the claimant filed further documentation on the income of the claimant and her husband.36 Included in these materials are tax receipts for her husband's businesses, and a statement of income for her husband in the year 2000. The documents state that these documents reflect her husband's income of XXXXX RMB per month for that year. No other evidence was lead as to the interpretation of the tax forms. For example, it is unclear whether this figure is the gross amount of income for the business or the net amount.\nOther documents filed at the hearing indicate that the claimant had HK$XX million in a bank account and over HK$XXXXX in a term deposit as of XXXXX 1998.37\nOne of the attachments to the claimant's affidavit is described as a receipt for a high interest account in the name of the claimant. It is put forward as proof of the claimant's investment income. The form of the document is of note. In her affidavit, the claimant describes it as a \"true copy with translation of a receipt for my term deposit investment bearing and annual interest rate of twenty one per cent. This was one of many term deposit investments I had made.\" The claimant's name appears on the form. It states:\n\"Hereby Received: Pool funds money from XXXXXXXX.\"\nThe form has a stamp that is translated as \"Guangzhou City Foreign Economic and Trade Commission Education and Training Section - Fees Collection Seal\".38\nThe claimant's evidence was that she was employed by the XXXXX XXXXX XXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX (XXXX), an organization with a very similar, if not identical, name. It is unclear why such a stamp would be on the form if it involved the claimant's private funds. What the reference to a \"Fee Collection Seal\" is on the receipt is also unclear.\nCounsel argues that the document shows the claimant did invest in high yield accounts. I find that the form is ambiguous. It may be referring to the claimant in her private capacity or it may be referring to the claimant in her capacity as an administrator in XXXX.\nIt is argued that the materials filed go to the credibility of the claimant in that it establishes that she and her husband had several sources of income that account for the value of their assets. In my view, some of the materials filed are ambiguous. In any event, the total amount of money set out in the various documents falls far short of the claimant's alleged worth. In my view the documentation does not establish on the balance of probabilities that the claimant and her husband earned the money she alleges they did over the years in question.\nThe Minister of Citizenship and Immigration intervened in this claim for refugee protection by a Notice of Intention to Participate.39 According to the notice, the Minister is of the opinion that the claimant is a fugitive wanted for prosecution by the Public Security Bureau Of Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China. Her alleged crime is the embezzlement of XX million RMB.\nThe basis of the intervention is to be found in a document provided to the Canadian Embassy in Beijing, China, from the Foreign Affairs Bureau of the Public Security Ministry of the People's Republic of China, dated XXXX, 2001.40 Because of its importance in this hearing, it is set out here in its entirety.\nPUBLIC SECURITY MINISTRY OF P.R.C.\nNOTE\nXXXXXXXXX\nTo Canadian Embassy in China:\nGreetings from the Foreign Affairs Bureau of the Public Security Ministry of the People's Republic of China to the Canadian Embassy in China.

It reads as follows:\nArticle 382.\nState personnel who take advantage of their office to misappropriate, steal, swindle or use other illegal means to acquire state properties constitute the crime of graft.\nThose who are entrusted by state organs, state companies, state enterprises, state undertakings and mass organizations to administer and operate state properties but take advantage of their office to misappropriate, steal, swindle or use other illegal means to acquire state properties also constitute the crime of graft.\nThose who collaborate with those personnel as listed in the aforementioned two paragraphs and join the crime are considered as committing a joint crime.\nThe penalties for an offence under section 382(1) are set out in Article 383 of the Criminal Law of China.43 The highest penalties possible are set out in section 383(1) and are as follows:\nArticle 383(1)\nIndividuals who have engaged in graft with an amount of more than 100,000 yuan are to be sentenced to more than 10 years of fixed-term imprisonment or life imprisonment and may, in addition, have their properties confiscated. In especially serious cases, those offenders are to be sentenced to death and, in addition, have their properties confiscated.\nCounsel for the claimant also filed numerous documents concerning the use of torture by the police in the handling of criminal suspects in China44 and in extracting confession from criminal suspects in China. The documentation is from a variety of reliable sources, and covers a number of years. There is also a considerable body of evidence as to the imposition of the death penalty in China for a wide variety of offences.\nIt is important to note there is no evidence before the panel that the government of Canada has sought and received assurances from the government of China as to how Ms. XXXX would be treated if she were returned to China. There is no agreement between the two governments as to the treatment the claimant would receive if she were incarcerated upon her return to China during any investigation nor any promise that she would not face the death sentence if found guilty of an offence under section 383(1).\nI would add that I have concern as to how the claimant's presence in Canada came to the attention of the Chinese authorities. As set out in the official note dated XXXXX 2001, the Chinese government was informed by the Canadian government that Ms. XXXX had made a refugee claim in Canada and was without documentation. It would appear that the Canadian government informed the alleged persecutor of the refugee claim, something that should not have happened. Indeed, the Minister's Representative was at pains to make it clear at the hearing that this should not have occurred.\nANALYSIS\nAs stated by counsel for the claimant and the Minister's Representative, the key issue in this claim is credibility. Contrary to the able argument of counsel for the claimant, I am of the view that Ms. XXXX was not credible. The claimant set out in some detail her position in the organization know as XXXX. She alleges that she was repeatedly asked to produce fraudulent documentation at the request of her superiors. The claimant refused to do what she was first asked - forge documents to fool a US trade investigation - in late 1996 or early 1997. From that point on she alleges her superior at XXXX did not trust her. He berated her in public and denigrated her work. Despite the mistrust and public humiliation, the claimant was not demoted nor did she quit. She carried on as before. Her financial situation if, as she alleged, the money was obtained legally, was such that she had no need to work at a relatively low paying job for many years.\nShe was again asked to produce forged documents in late 1997 or early 1998. Again she refused. In XXXXX 1999 she was asked to sign a document dismissing an employee of a company supervised by XXXX. The claimant found out this person had done nothing wrong and refused to sign the document. Again she disobeyed orders. In XXXX of 1999, the claimant was directed to take over the operations of a Hong Kong based company. The claimant was then told by her superior to implicate Ms. XXXXX in an embezzlement scheme. She was offered incentives to produce a fraudulent report. The claimant thought this incident was a ruse to trap her. She\nbelieved Ms. XXX was innocent of any crime. However, she did not know this for sure. In any event, she refused to do her superiors bidding once again. I do not find it plausible that the claimant would repeatedly be asked to produce fraudulent documents after repeatedly refusing to do so. If she were a known impediment to the alleged schemes of her superiors, she either would not have been repeatedly asked to act illegally or she would have been dismissed, demoted or transferred long before she fled.\nIn late XXXXX 1999 the claimant obtained information that she was being investigated as a result of an anonymous letter to the offices of the Procuratorate. She alleges she became convinced that she was being singled out for punishment by her superiors because she had not cooperated with them and had caused them to lose face. It appears her superiors achieved their goals by other means in each incident the claimant raised. It is unclear how they \"lost face\" with anyone. As I do not accept she was ever involved in the situations she describes, I do not find her evidence on this aspect of the evidence credible.\nThe claimant also alleges she kept a record of the various misdeeds of her colleagues in a notebook. This book also contained critiques of government economic policies and notes about meetings the claimant attended. Even though the claimant knew she too was suspected of misdeeds by investigators of the Procurators office she left her work without the notebook. I do not find it credible that the claimant would have kept the kind of notebook she describes for as long as she did and not retrieve it when she had ample opportunity to do so. Her manner of departure - simply disappearing from the scene - would also go to confirm for the Procuratorate that there were grounds to be suspicions of her actions. Although she alleges she had a detailed account of the misdeeds in her place of work, she did nothing to exonerate herself by bringing the information to the attention of the investigators.\nThe claimant alleges she escaped to Thailand and then to Venezuela. She never provided an explanation as to why she went to Venezuela for a year and a half. She attempted to get residency in Venezuela, but decided to flee that country as well. Contrary to her PIF, she was not \"in transit.\" The claimant never stated what success she had in getting Venezuelan residency. She alleges the police were looking for her in Venezuela, but was able to bribe her way out of the situation. She also alleges that she then left Venezuela because a Chinese gang member was\nmaking inquiries about her. She left her valid Chinese passport behind, saying she had no more use for it. Her passport would have been of great assistance to the panel in determining her actual travels and status in various countries. The photocopy provided to the panel was incomplete. The copy begs the question as to why a full version was not presented. I draw a negative inference from the absence of the passport.\nThe claimant provided an number of financial documents, primarily about her husband's income. The documents do not establish that he earned sufficient moneys to give his wife hundreds of thousands of RMB over several years. The term deposit slip she filed as evidence of a high rate of return on an investment is ambiguous. It is not clear whom this document refers to - either the claimant in her personal capacity or as an official of XXXX. It is clear that she had significant funds, as did her daughter, in other accounts.\nOverall, I do not find that the claimant was credible in her written or oral evidence. While it is apparent that the claimant fled China, I do not find it credible that she did so because she was victimized for refusing to follow shameful and illegal orders.\nI do find that the claimant had considerable funds in various accounts, and that the claimant's daughter had considerable funds in her own name in Hong Kong, despite her low paying job in Vancouver. Based on all the credible evidence, I do not find it credible or plausible that she accumulated all her wealth as she alleges.\nThe claimant never exposed anyone for anything in China. She was not a 'whistle blower.' There was no public political aspect to what she did.\nEXCLUSION AND INCLUSION\nIn this case, the evidence going to the claimant's alleged need for refugee protection and the Minister's evidence alleging exclusion are inextricably linked. The issue of exclusion will be considered first.\nThe Minister's Representative argues that the claimant is excludable under Article 1F(b) of the Schedule to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. If she is, she cannot be found to be a person in need of refugee protection under either section 96 or 97 of that Act. Article 1F(b) contains the following provisions:\nF. The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:\n(a) ...\n(b) he has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee;\n(c) ...\n[emphasis added]\nIn the Supreme Court of Canada decision of Pushpanathan,45 the Court stated:\nThus, the general purpose of Article 1F is not the protection of the society of refuge from dangerous refugees, whether because of acts committed before or after the presentation of a refugee claim; that purpose is served by Article 33 of the Convention. Rather, it is to exclude ab initio those who are not bona fide refugees at the time of their claim for refugee status.\nWhat follows is a consideration and application of the wording of Article 1F(b).\nMeaning of \"Serious Reasons for Considering\"\nAs stated in Sivakumar46 by the Federal Court of Appeal, \"serious reasons for considering\" is something more than suspicion or conjecture, but something less than the balance of probabilities. While that decision concerned the application of Article 1F(a), the phrase \"serious reasons for considering\" applies equally to all three grounds of exclusion under 1F.\nThe claimant's evidence that she is being pursued because she refused to follow shameful and unlawful orders is not credible. However, she did flee China. There is evidence that she had bank accounts with large sums of money in her name. Her daughter had a large sum of money in her own name, despite her low income. Although the claimant gave an explanation as to how she obtained these sums of money, some of the documents provided to confirm her story were inconclusive or ambiguous. As noted, given her personal fortune, it is unclear why the claimant would continue working in a relatively low paying job where she was regularly censured, humiliated, and asked to perform illegal acts.\nThe government of China has issued an Interpol warrant for the claimant's arrest. The warrant states that the claimant is wanted for embezzling a large sum of money. It specifies the dates during which the offence allegedly took place, the location, and the amount of money involved. The warrant identifies the claimant by photograph and by reference to her passport. The passport number in the Interpol document is the same as the passport number in the photocopy of the document presented by the claimant at the hearing. The warrant identifies the section of the Chinese Criminal Law alleged to be applicable. As pointed out by counsel for the claimant, the maximum penalty identified is incorrectly stated to be like imprisonment, not death. However, the possible penalty, whatever it might be, is not evidence of the offence.\nAs per the decision of Legault v. Canada (Secretary of State)47 I consider the materials put before me by the Minister's Representative credible and trustworthy evidence in the circumstances of this claim. While these materials might not be sufficient for extradition proceedings, that is not the process this panel is charged to undertake. So based on the entirety of evidence, there is \"serious reasons for considering\" the claimant committed an offence.\nMeaning of \"Serious\" Non-Political Crime\nThe next issue to be considered is what constitutes a \"serious\" crime. The Federal Court of Appeal decision of Chan48 presumed (without deciding) that a serious non-political crime is to be equated with one in which a maximum sentence of ten years or more could have been imposed had the crime been committed in Canada.49\nThe Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status (United Nations High Commission for Refugees, New Edition, Geneva, January 1992) gives the following definition of what constitutes a \"serious\" non-political crime:\n155. What constitutes a \"serious\" non-political crime for the purposes of this exclusion clause is difficult to define, especially since the term \"crime\" has different connotations in different legal systems. In some countries the word \"crime\" denotes only offences of a serious character. In other countries it may comprise anything from petty larceny to murder. In the present context, however, a \"serious\" crime must be a capital crime or a very grave punishable act. Minor offences punishable by moderate sentences are not grounds for exclusion under Article 1 F (b) even if technically referred to as \"crimes\" in the penal law of the country concerned.\nIn my view, Article 1F(b) contains no prohibition against serious non-violent economic crimes being the basis for exclusion.\nThe Minister's Representative argues that the charge against the claimant in China is equivalent to a charge of fraud under section 380 of the Criminal Code of Canada. That section reads as follows:\n380. (1) Every one who, by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means, whether or not it is a false pretence within the meaning of this Act, defrauds the public or any person, whether ascertained or not, of any property, money or valuable security or any service,\n(a) is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to a term of imprisonment not exceeding ten years, where the subject-matter of the offence is a testamentary instrument or the value of the subject-matter of the offence exceeds five thousand dollars; ...\nAs counsel for the claimant points out, a person can be sentenced to death in China for an \"especially serious cases\" of graft.\nIn my view a charge of embezzlement in China and fraud in Canada for the amount alleged constitutes a serious non-political crime both in Canada and China for the purposes of the exclusion provisions.\nI find that there are serious reasons for considering the claimant committed the serious non-political offence of embezzlement of a substantial amount of money outside the country of refuge and is a person described in Article 1 F(b). The effect of this finding is set out in section 98 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. It states:\nA person referred to in section E or F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\nINCLUSION\nAlthough it is not necessary to make a finding on inclusion, given the gravity of the situation, I will go on to consider sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Section 96 is as follows:\nA Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,\n(a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or\n(b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.\nIn my view, there is no link between the definition of a Convention refugee in section 96 of the Act and the claimant. She was not a credible witness. She did not flee China because she was a victim of an attempt to force her to indulge in corrupt practices. She was not a \"whistle blower,\" and denounced no one. There is nothing in this claim to bring the facts within the purview of the Klinko50 decision. The evidence is such that there are substantial reasons to believe she fled China to avoid prosecution. However, that is not the end of the matter. Section 97 of the Act must also be considered. That section reads as follows:\n97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\n(a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or\n(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\n(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\n(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\n(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.\nThe claimant alleges that if she were to be returned to China and face prosecution for her alleged wrongdoing, she would be abused in prison and her conviction would be a foregone conclusion. She might face the death penalty as a result. After reviewing the extensive documentary materials filed in this claim, I am of the view that there is more than a mere possibility that this claimant would face being tortured while incarcerated in the investigation leading up to any charges being laid.\nIn coming to this conclusion, I apply the standard of proof as set out in the decision of Adjei.51 In my view, to apply a higher standard would be wrong. To paraphrase a previous decision of RPD,52 it is inappropriate, unjust and inequitable to impose on an asylum seeker who feared torture and cruel and unusual treatment a heavier burden of proof than that imposed on someone who feared persecution on one of the grounds set out in the definition of a Convention refugee.\nBeing tortured as a criminal suspect cannot be considered a risk inherent in the application of a lawful sanction.\nNot having to decide the matters, I will not go on to consider the issue of the potential for an unfair trial or the potential imposition of the death penalty should the claimant be found guilty of the offence of embezzlement.\nWere the claimant not excluded from the definition of a person in need of refugee protection she would be a person described in Section 97(1)(a) as a person in need of protection.\nDECISION\nI find that the claimant XXXXXXXX, having been found a person described in Article 1F(b), is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\n\"Kurt Neuenfeldt\"\nKurt Neuenfeldt\nJanuary 17, 2003\nDate\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - EXCLUSION CLAUSES - ART. 1F(b) - SERIOUS NON-POLITICAL CRIME - CRIMINAL CODE - CREDIBILITY - PERSON IN NEED OF PROTECTION -TORTURE - FEMALE - NEGATIVE - CHINA\n1 Exhibit 1, Personal Information Form, section 10 Addendum, question 1.\n2 Maldonado v.

The claimants are both citizens of the United States of America.\nFACTUAL ALLEGATION\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (hereafter referred to as Ms. XXXX) says that since approximately 1990, she and her son have been the victims of a long-standing series of actions undertaken against them in the United States. Since that time, there has been an ongoing conspiracy between various governmental authorities (including the federal and various state governments, along with subsidiary groups such as intelligence organizations), in combination with the active connivance of various large corporations and politicians to blacklist Ms. XXXX from gainful employment, to keep the claimants under constant surveillance in various locations in the United States, and even to physically harm them. As a result of this ongoing campaign against them, the claimants have been forced to leave the United States and came to Canada, where they later claimed refugee status. They believe that they are still subject to active surveillance resulting in persecution up to date.\nDETERMINATION\nThe panel determines that these claimants are not Convention refugees, nor are they persons in need of protection\nANALYSIS\nThe claimants were not represented by legal counsel at the oral hearing. Several lawyers had previously represented them, but that representation had ended some considerable time prior to the hearing. Because there was no prospect of the claimants obtaining legal counsel within a reasonable time, a pre-hearing conference was held on August 13, 2002. At that time, and with the concurrence of the claimants, the hearing was set for October 18, 2002. A Refugee Protection Officer (RPO) was present to assist the panel during the proceedings.\nMs. XXXX has been the sole custodial parent for the minor claimant for a number of years. As she appeared to be willing and able to act in his best interests, she was the appropriate person to designate as his representative1 for the purposes of this proceeding.\nMs. XXXX provided the only oral testimony. She chose not to have her son testify, although he was present throughout the proceedings. Throughout the oral hearing, she appeared to be calm and articulate. She was able to answer questions clearly, provide details when required, and to make appropriate comments. At no time did she appear to be confused or to have a lack of understanding about the nature of these proceedings.\nThe claimants provided Personal Information Forms (PIFs).2 Ms. XXXX own PIF contained an exceptionally long and detailed narrative, comprising three Schedules and some 97 typed pages. It alleged a lengthy period of harassment, persecution and surveillance that commenced in approximately 1990 under the first Bush administration and then continued on during both the Clinton administration and the current Bush administration. The claimants alleged that their problems started around 1990 when there were a series of break-ins at Ms. XXXX apartment in which copies were made of certain of her documents containing important information. These illegal actions were allegedly carried out by various government officials and agencies. Some of this stolen information was leaked to the media and other information utilized in order to harass her.\nAt this time in early 1990, the adult claimant was an unpaid XXXX for the XXXXXX XXXXX of the Supreme Court of the state of North Carolina. While she was only there for a brief period of some weeks, she uncovered certain political machinations being conducted by some employees of the Court. As a result of her knowledge, she learned that his Republican Party opponents in North Carolina initiated a campaign against the XXXXXXX, a Democrat. To avoid being involved in this campaign because of personal problems already afflicting her that arose from an earlier sexual assault, she left that position after the XXXXX warned her that she had been blacklisted.\nFrom that point onwards, Ms. XXXX alleged that there was a conspiracy against her. Participants in that conspiracy included not only Republican Party operatives and officials, but also senior Democratic Party officials, including former President Clinton. She alleged that the political and intelligence communities, as well as various governments (from the state and federal level) and large U.S. corporations, including some of the mass media, have been involved in persecuting her for her political opinion. The conspiracy and blacklisting have prevented her from obtaining meaningful employment since that time and forced them to live at poverty levels. In addition, she alleges that there is no location in the United States where she and her son will be safe or can live peacefully.\nMs. XXXX also alleged that the conspiracy\/campaign not only had the object of spreading accusations and rumours about her in order to cause psychological harm, but she also alleged that there were a number of attempts to physically harm her and her son, which have been set out throughout her PIF narrative. Some examples of the allegations selected from her PIF narrative include tampering with her automobile, denial of vital medical care, accusations and rumours to destroy her psychological balance. She also alleged that her own government was holding her \"...under 'surveillance' for 24 hours a day, every day of the year, for over 11 YEARS and counting\".3\nMany of Ms. XXXX allegations involved her ability to be aware of and to know about the content of private discussions held about her by the highest officials of successive U.S. administrations including, as previously mentioned, former President Clinton, current Vice-President Dick Cheney, and former President George Bush Sr. Although her complaints initially started with the former Bush administration, she also alleged that her problems continued under the new Clinton administration. As one example, Ms. XXXX alleged that there was also a continuous violation of her privacy during President Bill Clinton's term of office. According to allegations in her PIF narrative4, she had made disparaging comments about President Clinton and, as a result, he \"...is well documented to have eavesdropped on my home virtually every single day he was in office and was rumoured to have vowed vengeance\". It was never established how she would know that he had undertaken such a campaign against her.\nIt was noticeable that although Ms. XXXX gave lengthy allegations about the persons and organizations involved in this campaign against them, she could provide no factual information to support this alleged conspiracy and persecution. It was noticeable that Ms. XXXX had filed numerous requests for copies of media and government records, but without any concrete success. During much of the hearing, she alleged that she had supporting documents, which were either in storage in the United States or were available. However, she admitted that she had not obtained these documents and was unable to unsatisfactorily explain her inability to provide such documents for this proceeding, particularly those that she had left in storage in the United States. Many of the materials filed by the claimants were simply responses by various organizations to her unsuccessful requests for information.\nAlthough Ms. XXXX alleged that there was widespread knowledge of this campaign against them, she was unable to provide any quotes or references of any kind from media sources to confirm any of her allegations. Indeed, since the oral hearing concluded, the claimant has also filed a number of documents with the Board alleging that her fear now extends to here in Canada. The panel has taken all of the materials, including those submitted by her after the oral hearing, into consideration in the determination of these claims.\nMs. XXXX essential explanation for her lack of supporting evidence was to say that various governmental institutions, media sources and other organizations always stonewalled her when she tried to get information from them either to confirm her allegations or to seek assistance. Her inability to corroborate in any way that this conspiracy had ever occurred, combined with the complete lack of evidence that she was ever of interest to any of the alleged participants to the conspiracy, simply exhibited the basic problems at the heart of these claims. The claimants believe that since they have been in Canada, the conspiracy\/campaign against them has continued unabated and, in effect, it has now been joined with the concurrence and\/or connivance of certain Canadian officials.\nMixed in with the allegations of governmental misdeeds are complaints that Ms. XXXX former husband (the father of the minor claimant) has failed to make regular support payments for his son and has also failed to have any real interest in the boy as he grew up. Ms. XXXX also added complaints about her own family, including her lack of contact with her brothers and her minimal contact with a sister. She has also included problems with her parents because they have told her they do not want them to come back to the United States. She alleges that they are not comfortable with XXXXXXX because he is a bi-racial child. Ms. XXXX also alleged that because she is a potential witness in a pending court case in the United States, she is in danger there. According to her, the records relating to that case are also in storage in Little Rock, Arkansas. She had numerous other complaints, which involved repeated failure to obtain or to afford proper medical treatment, sexual abuse, and deprivation of the necessities of life, among many others.\nAnother example of the lack of credibility of her evidence concerned her hiring by the U.S. federal government to work on the 2000 census. She was unable to explain why, if the federal government was persecuting her, they would have offered her such a job. She also was unable to satisfactorily explain why she quit that job shortly thereafter, so she and her son could go off to Mexico. They were there for some three months until XXXXXXXX became sick, so they returned to Arkansas for medical treatment. While in Mexico, they met a couple from British Columbia (whose names she could not recall) who told them that they would enjoy it in B.C. According to her, that is why they eventually came here to Canada, so they could get away from the 24-hour surveillance, which they find to be emotionally draining, and to find freedom from that sort of harassment.\nIndeed, it was difficult at times to understand the basis of their claims. On one hand, Ms. XXXX alleged that there were attempts to murder them or, in effect, to drive them out of the United States. On the other hand, she also alleged that her enemies in the United States did not want them to leave originally so they could maintain control over them. Now that they have left, they want them to go back there. Asked to explain this apparent contradiction, her only answer was to say that those people are doing it to be cruel to them.\nThe lengthy PIF narrative concludes with allegations about the extension of the campaign against her into the international sphere, even beyond the United States and Canada. For example, in Schedule 2 of her PIF narrative, Ms. XXXX alleged that she was involved with the French Intelligence services over a series of bombings in France in the 1980's. She alleged that she was an honest broker in resolving these bombings. She also mentioned that other international leaders, such as President Mubarak of Egypt, knew about her case. As another example in her PIF, she alleged that she received information from the Chinese government. However, when pressed, she basically explained that she could not disclose or reveal how she knew about certain information. This was because the U.S. authorities are attempting to break the code that she uses to communicate with her sources, particularly those in China.\nIn Schedule 3 of her PIF narrative, she did allege that certain well-known international officials were aware of their situation. Some of these officials, amongst others, included Pope John Paul II, President Jacques Chirac of France, Russian President Putin, and U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan. However, it was also noted that none of these persons did provide any evidence to support their claims.\nIn almost every instance, the sources of the claimants' allegations were based solely upon nothing more substantial than speculation, rumours, or distant hearsay. It was implausible that no independent documentary evidenced would be available to support their allegations that governmental officials\/authorities in the U.S.(whether federal or state) or any other organizations are pursuing the claimants by a campaign of surveillance or harassment. As the Federal Court of Appeal stated in Adu5:\nThe \"presumption\" that a claimant's sworn testimony is true is always rebuttable, and, in appropriate circumstances, may be rebutted by the failure of the documentary evidence to mention what one would normally expect it to mention.\nIn an open society such as the United States, a country with a free press and widespread access to information by the public, the lack of such documentary evidence is another factor adversely affecting the credibility of the claimants' evidence.\nIn considering these claims, the panel has also considered the overall situation in the United States. It is not a perfect society as it does have problems, including social problems that affect many individuals during periods of their lives. It may be that these claimants have been through some personal problems in the past, but there is no credible evidence that there is (or was) any conspiracy or campaign against her and her son as they alleged. Ms. XXXX long list of complaints indicates that her responses to normal day-to-day events, particularly unfavourable ones, have been completely taken out of proportion and she has given them instead a sinister and malevolent intent. Overall, the panel found there was a complete lack of credible or trustworthy evidence to support their claims. The claimants' allegations did not meet the test of \"rationality and common sense.\"6\nEven if the panel had accepted their allegations as credible, Ms. XXXX has not presented evidence sufficient to overcome the presumption that in a country such as the United States, they could resolve their alleged problems domestically by means of the existing legal mechanisms available there, without seeking protection abroad. As was stated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Ward7, a refugee claimant has the onus of overcoming the presumption of a state's ability to protect her.\nAbsent a situation of complete breakdown of state apparatus, ... it should be assumed that the state is capable of protecting a claimant.8\nThe Court required a claimant to advance \"clear and convincing\" evidence of the state's inability to afford her protection.\nAlthough this presumption increases the burden on the claimant, it does not render illusory Canada's provision of a haven for refugees. The presumption serves to reinforce the underlying rationale of international protection as a surrogate, coming into play where no alternative remains to the claimant. Refugee claims were never meant to allow a claimant to seek out better protection than that from which he or she benefits already.9\nFor these claimants, it is only when protection in the United States is unavailable to them that Canada's responsibility to provide international protection as a surrogate becomes engaged.\nThe Supreme Court, in Ward, also considered with approval the earlier decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in the case of Satiacum.10 That case dealt an unsuccessful claim for protection as a Convention refugee by an American native leader who fled from the U.S. after his criminal conviction but before sentencing. His fear of persecution was the risk to his life from incarceration in a U.S. federal prison. The Court of Appeal dealt with the judicial process in a foreign country, and in the United States in particular, as follows:\nIn the absence of exceptional circumstances established by the claimant, it seems to me that in a Convention refugee hearing, as in an extradition hearing, Canadian tribunals have to assume a fair and independent judicial process in the foreign case. In the case of a non-democratic state, contrary evidence might be readily forthcoming, but in relation to a democracy like the United States contrary evidence might have to go to the extent of substantially impeaching, for example, the jury selection process in the relevant part of the country, or the independence or fair-mindedness of the judiciary itself.\n...\nAgain, in the absence of proof by the refugee claimant, Canadian tribunals must assume a fair trial. The notion of a fair trial in a fair and independent judicial system must make allowance for the self-correcting mechanisms within the system, e.g., the trial judge's control over the excesses of the participants, and the control of the appellant courts over any errors of the trial judge.11\nThe Federal Court of Appeal, in the case of Kadenko,12 also dealt with the issue of state protection and the burden of proof on a claimant from a democratic state.\nOnce it is assumed that the state ... has political and judicial institutions capable of protecting its citizens, it is clear that the refusals of certain officers to take action cannot in itself make the state incapable of doing so. ...\nWhen the state in question is a democratic state ... the claimant must do more than simply show that he or she went to see some members of the police force and that his or her efforts were unsuccessful. The burden of proof that rest on the claimant is, in a way, directly proportional to the level of democracy in the state in question: the more the democratic the state's institutions, the more the claimant must have done to exhaust all the courses of action open to him or her.\nFor these particular claimants, their burden of proof is directly proportional to the level of democracy in the United States.13 In effect, the claimants must show that they have taken all steps reasonable in the circumstances to seek protection in the United States. This is because that country is an advanced democratic state with a written constitution and a division of powers, characterized by the principle of checks and balances. It also has a functioning and well-established legal system with independent judicial institutions at the local, state and national levels that are available to the claimants to seek effective redress.\nIn the more recent decision of Smith,14 the Federal Court also dealt with refugee claimants, a mother and minor child, from the United States. In that case, the Court, after considering Ward, Satiacum and Kadenko, also found that those claimants had not:\n...established the \"clear and convincing' proof required to rebut the presumption of state protection.\nThese particular claimants have not satisfied the panel that they could not achieve redress for their problems in the United States. If there was any credible basis underlying their allegations, it would seem reasonable to conclude that there are available and effective institutions capable of either providing redress or assisting them to achieve it. In addition to being able to lodge direct complaints with the police, the claimants do have the option of initiating legal proceedings before the appropriate American courts. Such courts have the power to control government actions, prevent government excesses, and award substantial monetary damages, if proof of wrongdoing can be established. If these claimants believe they have been subject to any wrongdoing in the United States, they have not come anywhere near to overcoming the onus upon them regarding state protection because they have not even begun to access, let alone exhaust, any such remedies that do exist within that country, before they can seek international protection here.\nAlthough these claims were initiated under the provisions of the former Immigration Act15, no substantive evidence was adduced before the coming into force of the new Immigration and Refugee Protection Act16 (IRPA). Accordingly, the claims have been assessed and analyzed under the provisions of sections 96 and 97 of IRPA. There is no \"serious possibility\"17 that either of these claimants have any well-founded fear of persecution, based upon any of the Convention refugee grounds (section 96), in the United States of America. Furthermore, there is also no credible evidence that these claimants face a danger of torture or a risk to their lives or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment (section 97) in that country. Reasonable state protection is available to them in the United States.\nThe minor claimant based his claim upon that of his mother. As her evidence was found to not be credible or trustworthy, no other independent evidence was presented to support his claim.\nCONCLUSION\nAfter a consideration of all of the evidence, including the materials filed after the oral hearing (the observations of the RPO and the submissions and other materials of the claimants), the Refugee Protection Division determines that these claimants are not Convention refugees, nor are they persons in need of protection.\nThe panel also considered that the only evidence linking the claimants to the alleged harm feared was found in the testimony of Ms. XXXX. As that evidence was found to not be credible, there was no independent and credible documentary evidence that would otherwise support a positive determination of these refugee claims. The absence of any credible or trustworthy evidence18 leads the panel to conclude that there is no credible basis19 to these claims.\nAccordingly, the panel rejects the claims of XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (also known as XXXXXXXXXXXX) and XXXXXXXXXXXX for refugee protection.\n\"I.W.

They claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution from Serbian gangsters by reason of their race as Serbian Hungarians. In addition, they claim to be persons in need of protection because they would be subjected personally to a risk to their lives or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Hungary.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe following is a synopsis of the male claimant's story taken from his Personal Information Form (PIF)1 and supplemented by the evidence at the hearing. XXXXXXXXXX was appointed the designated representative of his infant daughters. At his request they were excused from the hearing.\nAn earlier Interlocutory Decision had been rendered granting severance of these claimants' claims from that of their mother XXXXXXXXX.\nThe male claimant's mother is of Serbian ancestry; his father is ethnic Hungarian. In 1992 while buying clothing in Subotica, Yugoslavia the claimant met XXXXX and XXXXX who sold clothing in the market place. They were Yugoslavian of Serbian ancestry. Over the course of the next year and one half they became better acquainted. The claimant2 mentioned to them that he was of partly Serbian ancestry.\nAt the end of 1993 XXXXX and XXXXX appeared at the claimant's home in Hungary. They went out for a beer and on the drive back they asked him to give supplies for the \"Greater Serbia\" cause. The claimant refused. They beat him up and broke his nose convincing him in the process to co-operate. They warned the claimant not to go to the police or they would kill him and his family. The claimant obeyed and over the ensuing two years delivered various goods across the border to XXXXX and XXXXX. It cost the claimant about 10,000 Forints (HF) each time he\nloaded his car with goods and over the period he delivered free of charge many carloads of items. Eventually, his business and financial situation deteriorated and he told XXXXX and XXXXX that he could not continue. They complained but left him alone.\nIn January 1998 XXXXX and XXXXX re-appeared and insisted that the claimant pay them 100,000 HF monthly as protection money. To drive the point home they placed a pistol against his head. The claimant paid this money until May 1999 when XXXXX and XXXXX disappeared again. However, XXXXX re-appeared in January 2000 and the claimant again paid 100,000 HF a month until XXXXX 2001 when he fled to Canada. The claimant's wife and children followed a few months later.\nAt no point did the claimant ever seek protection from the police or other governmental authority.\nDETERMINATION\nI find that the claimants are not Convention refugees, as they do not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in Hungary. I also find that the claimants are not persons in need of protection in that their removal to Hungary would not subject them personally to a risk to their lives or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, and in that there are no substantial grounds to believe that their removal to Hungary will subject them personally to a danger of torture. My reasons follow.\nIDENTITY\nThe claimants' identities as nationals of Hungary are established by the male claimant's testimony and the supporting documentation filed, namely, certified copies of their passports.\nANALYSIS\nCredibility\nThe panel found the claimant to be essentially a credible witness. Although there were some discrepancies in his testimony, the panel found the claimant testified spontaneously and avoided embellishing his story, except with respect to what XXXXX and XXXXX said about having connections with the police in Hungary.\nState Protection\nThe determinative issue raised in this claim is that of state protection. In Ward, the Supreme Court of Canada articulated the \"rationale underlying the international refugee protection regime\" as follows:\nThe international community intended that persecuted individuals be required to approach their home state for protection before the responsibility of other states becomes engaged. For this reason, James Hathaway refers to the refugee scheme as \"surrogate or substitute protection\", activated only upon failure of national protection....3\nThe Supreme Court underlined this point when it stated that:\nAbsent a situation of complete breakdown of state apparatus, such as that recognized in Lebanon in Zalzali, it should be assumed that the state is capable of protecting a claimant.4\nThe Supreme Court held that this presumption might be rebutted where the claimant \"provides\" or \"advances\" \"clear and convincing proof\" or \"clear and convincing confirmation\" of the state's inability to protect.5 Whether a claimant need also have literally approached his or her state for protection to rebut the presumption, the Supreme Court stated that:\n...only in situations in which state protection \"might reasonably have been forthcoming\", will the claimant's failure to approach the state for protection defeat his claim. Put another way, the claimant will not meet the definition of a \"Convention refugee\" where it is objectively unreasonable for the claimant not to have sought the protection of his home authorities; otherwise the claimant need not literally approach the state.6\nThe claimants have the onus of rebutting the presumption that their state is capable of providing protection.\nThe Claimants' Situation\nIn this case the claimant did not approach the state. In his PIF he advanced two reasons for not doing so:\nThey beat me up, breaking my nose. They then threatened me and told me not to go to the police. They said that if either of them got caught, hundreds of them would come after my entire family and me, and that they would finish us all. I was afraid to go to the police because I was scared.7\nFurther on in his PIF the claimant gave a different, though related reason:\nHungary during this time had just emerged from communism. Under the new economy, the police force became corrupt; and the low wages they earned contributed to this corruption. Because of their low salaries they couldn't keep up the fight against organized crime that was becoming prevalent in Hungary. It is for the above reason that I chose not to report the blackmail and the attack I had suffered in 1993 at the hands of these Serbian extremists to the police. I felt that the police would not be able to protect my family and me.8\nDuring his hearing the claimant advanced a third reason: on the day his nose had been broken XXXXX and XXXXX had informed him that they had connections within the police and if he did report them they would know and come after him.\nSo afraid was the claimant that he did not tell anyone other than his wife. He even feared telling his parents because he was certain that they would inform the police. He told no acquaintances or friends for the same reason. The claimant was asked whether he went to a lawyer. He responded\nthat he did not do so as all a lawyer would suggest would be to send him to the police. Tellingly, the claimant also stated that even if the police were to arrest XXXXX and XXXXX his cohorts would find him and his family.\nAsked what kind of protection he wanted, the claimant stated that he would need 24-hour protection and he was certain that the police would not provide that.\nSummarising the claimant's position he is stating that he was afraid to go to the police because (a) they were ineffective at controlling organised crime and were corrupt; (b) even if he did go, the police connections of XXXXX and XXXXX would lead to him being attacked; and (c) even if the police did arrest XXXXX and XXXXX their cohorts would attack him in retribution. In essence there are two issues in this case: Firstly, has the claimant established that it would be \"objectively unreasonable\" for him to approach the state for protection. In order to answer this we will review the state of organised crime and police corruption in Hungary. The second issue concerns the level of protection the state must offer the claimant.\nWhat is the objective situation in Hungary with respect to organised crime and police corruption?\nTHE OBJECTIVE SITUATION IN HUNGARY\nOrganised Crime in Hungary\nThere is no question that there is a great deal of organised criminal activity in Hungary.9 The objective documentation supports the claimant's story to the extent that organised criminal gangs are prevalent in Hungary today and have been growing steadily since the collapse of communism in 1990. However, the Research Directorate of the IRB could find no mention of Serbian nationalist extremists extorting money from Hungarians of Serbian nationality between 1993 and 2001.10 Given the extensive amount of published information on organized crime in Hungary the panel is of the view that if there were such Serbian extremists a search would reveal it. Counsel drew our attention to YUG33531.E,11 which refers to the President of the Serbian Radical Party and its support for a \"Greater Serbia.\" The panel notes this but does not find that it supports a link between this political party and XXXXX and XXXXX criminal organisation.\nIs Hungary making \"serious efforts\"12 to combat organised crime? While it is acknowledged that organised crime is a serious issue in Hungary, it must also be noted that the Hungarian government is taking steps to combat organised crime. The documentary evidence makes it clear that Hungary is making serious efforts to combat it and enjoying some level of success.13 The founding of an International Law Enforcement Academy in Budapest in 1996 was a joint Hungarian-US initiative aimed at training East European police forces in crime-fighting techniques. FBI agents have also advised Hungarian officers in dealing with a number of criminal cases, even prompting rumours that a FBI office was to be set up in Budapest. This relationship has borne fruit, with two alleged Mafia members from Hungary being arrested in Miami, Florida.14 As well, efforts to curb organised crime in Hungary have met with considerable success.\nViktor Orban's FIDESZ-Hungarian Civic Party, which was elected in July 1998, made fighting organised crime a centerpiece of his government's programme. Orban put before parliament a range of measures designed to prevent criminal operations and reduce existing crime levels.15 The Orban government has also increased the levels of authority and the funding available to police involved in the fight against crime. On entering office in 1998, Orban pledged to increase investment in the police by US$539 million over a 10-year period. In February 2000 a new police centre dedicated to fighting cross-border crime opened in Budapest, designed to facilitate co-operation and information sharing with police forces in other European countries.16 On 10 May 2001, The Budapest Sun reported the arrest of six members of two criminal groups by the National Police Directorate Against Organized Crime. The groups were allegedly involved in a credit card fraud that caused damages of 12 million Forints.17 And finally as quoted in HUN38872.E:\nIn an effort to crack down on organized crime, the Budapest police reportedly raided more than 250 bars and night-clubs allegedly controlled by organized crime groups in July 2001 (The Budapest Sun 12 July 2001). ... According to a Budapest police spokesperson, the operation involved 80-85 police and was assisted by personnel from the tax, public health and customs offices (ibid.). The spokesperson also claimed that the actions taken by the police had \"intimidated\" some organized criminal groups.18\nIn the panels view the documentary evidence supports the view that the Hungarian government is demonstrating serious efforts to combat organised crime.\nPolice Corruption in Hungary\nIn the claimant's mind, the corruption of the police is so severe that he concluded that it was reasonable not to have to seek protection. There is no question that there is police corruption in Hungary19. How serious a problem is it?\nAccording to an international study conducted by the United Nations Research Institute on Crime and the Criminal Justice System, 35 per cent of Hungarian police officers would accept a bribe (The Budapest Sun Online 25 May 2000). Commenting on this percentage, Gyula Kandik\u00f3, Budapest's Deputy Chief Prosecutor and Head of the Prosecutor's Investigation Office claimed that \"the situation was not so critical\" (ibid.). However, The Budapest Sun Online stated that the level of corruption of the police forces was not only \"perceived to be high\", but also had increased over the years (ibid.). According to the National Institute of Criminology, the number of reported cases of corruption in the police ranks had increased fivefold between 1995 and 1999, from 25 to 129 (ibid.). These figures include reports by police officers of bribes offered to them, although Mr. Kandik\u00f3 acknowledged that these cases are \"relatively rare\"20\nHowever, Hungary is taking steps to remedy this situation. In a bid to assess the magnitude of corruption within the police ranks, the Interior Minister introduced \"security risk check-ups\" performed on police officers by the defense service. In a first stage, the check-ups were said to concern officers at risk of corruption and those suspected of any legal violation. Under a plan defining the procedures, the service may monitor the behaviour of a police officer in different situations, including \"pre-arranged\" ones, although it cannot incite monitored police officers to break regulations or prevent them from performing their duties, and it must abide by regulations.21 In late 1999, the Interior Minister was reported to have taken several measures to address the problem of police corruption. For example, the performance, the financial situation, the occupation(s) and the contacts of police officers, in particular those working close to the public would be \"thoroughly and continuously\" monitored. The authorities also intended to punish police officers that failed to report colleagues they suspected of being corrupt.22\nStaff at the Security Service of Law Enforcement Agencies of the Ministry of Interior say that it is responsible for the prevention, detection and investigation of corruption cases within law-enforcement agencies which have increased by 86%. A new work programme has been adopted for the prevention of corruption of staff of law-enforcement and public-safety services. Within the police, a specialised mobile unit has been set up to detect street corruption of police officers. Their tasks include detecting and reporting of officers taking bribes from citizens and starting disciplinary action or criminal proceedings against them. In 2000, a total of 800 such cases were detected, 200 of them by this unit. Training in this area also continued. In order to strengthen the fight against money laundering, the Financial Intelligence Unit within the Hungarian National Police was further strengthened through the recruitment of additional staff.23\nAccording to the Washington Post, in the March 23, 2000 edition, Hungary, in its fight against police corruption, has introduced more measures than any other central and east-European country. The DOS Report for 200124 states:\nThe police and Interior Ministry continued to work to change the authoritarian image of the police, and human rights organizations report that police generally were more cooperative with outside monitoring of police behavior.\nFinally, the government's desire to combat corruption can be demonstrated by the recent prosecution of governmental authorities:\nReporting on the \"mafia case\" in Szekesfehervar (western Hungary), Hungarian Radio indicated on 27 February 2002 that the Central Investigation Department of the Prosecutor's Office had laid charges against 23 individuals, including police officers, lawyers, a prison officer, a prosecutor and a prosecution investigator. The charges comprised bribery of officials, abuse of authority, document forgery, economic crime and violation of state secrets (Hungarian Radio 27 Feb. 2002).25\nIn the panel's view the government of Hungary is making serious efforts to combat police corruption and these efforts are experiencing success. Consequently, in the panel's view the failure of the claimant to even approach any governmental authorities for protection is objectively unreasonable.\nEFFECTIVENESS OF STATE PROTECTION FOR THE CLAIMANT\nThe claimant also raised the issue of whether the police could offer him effective protection. In his testimony, as adverted to earlier in these reasons, the claimant appeared to accept that the police might have been able to arrest XXXXX and XXXXX but stated that other gang members would come after him.\nThe court in Ward26 did not deal with the issue of the effectiveness of state protection. The Federal Court of Appeal has dealt with the issue to some extent in two cases, which at first blush appear to be in opposition.\nIn Villafranca,27 which was a case where a policeman from the Philippines fled the country after a communist terrorist guerilla group targeted him, the court stated:\nThe burden of showing that one is not able to avail oneself of the protection of one's own state is not easily satisfied. The test is an objective one and involves the claimant showing either that he is physically prevented from seeking his government's aid (clearly not the case here) or that the government itself is in some way prevented from giving it.\nNo government that makes any claim to democratic values or protection of human rights can guarantee the protection of all of its citizens at all times. Thus, it is not enough for a claimant merely to show that his government has not\nalways been effective at protecting persons in his particular situation. Terrorism in the name of one warped ideology or another is a scourge afflicting many societies today; its victims, however much they may merit our sympathy, do not become convention refugees simply because their governments have been unable to suppress the evil. Where, however, the state is so weak, and its control over all or part of its territory so tenuous as to make it a government in name only, as this Court found in the case of Zalzali v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) a refugee may justly claim to be unable to avail himself of its protection. Situations of civil war, invasion or the total collapse of internal order will normally be required to support a claim of inability. On the other hand, where a state is in effective control of its territory, has military, police and civil authority in place, and makes serious efforts to protect its citizens from terrorist activities, the mere fact that it is not always successful at doing so will not be enough to justify a claim that the victims of terrorism are unable to avail themselves of such protection.28\nHowever, in the later case of Mendivil,29 the Federal Court of Appeal also analysed the issue of the effectiveness of state protection. Mendivil was a case where the claimant, an ex-mayor in Peru, had been targeted by the Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path), had fled his country after learning that he was a target of the Sendero Luminoso. He told the Board that a former colleague and former mayor of another town had also been assassinated. The court in arriving at the decision to refer the case back to the Board mentioned that the Board had not had the benefit of the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in Ward before arriving at its conclusion. It also pointed out that the Board, in arriving at its negative conclusion, had not referred to the documentary evidence that showed that the Shining Path had successfully assassinated several public figures, nor adequately dealt with the evidence that showed that the state might not have been effectively in control of all of Peru, particularly where the claimant was living in Peru. As the court put it:\nIn their reasons, the Board members alluded to the fact that the claimant was able to live in Lima without \"adverse consequences\" until his departure in 1991. This, in itself, is not conclusive of the matter since, notwithstanding that fact, a claimant may still fear persecution and have good grounds for fearing persecution. They then pursued but gave no clear indication as to the effective portions of the evidence they focused on when they made their finding that the government authorities and agencies \"were making successful efforts to counter-act insurgency and violence in Peru\". While they referred to a reduction in the number of provinces under emergency and noted that the police and not the army was responsible for the security in the capital of Lima where the claimant resided, I still wonder which inferences were drawn which would explain their conclusion. Nor did the Board members explain why the protection this claimant could enjoy as an ordinary person was adequate in the circumstances. The Board members do not appear to have considered the possibility that persons specifically targeted, who may qualify as members of a\nparticular social group, might still have good grounds for fearing persecution when a state is capable of protecting ordinary citizens but incapable of protecting members of that particular social group. In addition, I cannot be sure that the Board members appreciated the facts in their entirety, since they did not refer to the 1992 events. I remain in doubt as to whether the evidence as a whole was considered.30\nIt appears that the court in Mendivil was dissatisfied with the documentary analysis of the Board, particularly because there was evidence indicating that people in the position of the claimant had been successfully targeted and assassinated by the Shining Path.\nIt should be noted that the decision of the court in Mendivil, although subsequent to that of Villafranca, refers and quotes from that case and does not reverse it. I conclude from that the court did not see the cases as arriving at conflicting positions. In Villafranca the claimant was a member of the state - a policeman. In Mendivil the claimant was a former member of the state who, when he was mayor, enjoyed 24-hour protection. In Villafranca there was no indication that the Philippines were not in control of its territory, whereas the documentary evidence on Peru - focused on by the court - was that the government was not in control of all its territory and in fact had not been able to prevent assassinations in Lima where the claimant lived. It is important to note that the court referred the claim back to the Board with specific request that it consider the documentary evidence more fully. The court in Mendivil also quotes from Villafranca the passage that: \"Situations of civil war, invasion or the total collapse of internal order will normally be required to support a claim of inability.\"\nIn the panel's view the court in Mendivil had in mind the possibility that Peru was a country that might be in a state of \"profound unrest\"31 and a situation where persons in similar situations to the claimant had been assassinated. Hungary is not in a situation of profound unrest. Also, here we have no such similar circumstances - no evidence was led that persons in the situation of the claimant have been targeted and killed. The claimant is not a prominent person. As noted, he even suggested that the police might have arrested the extortionists. As a result, Mendivil does not apply and the burden remains upon the claimant of providing clear and convincing proof that state protection would not be available.\nHave the claimants provided such proof? This is not a case where the agents of persecution are the state. Neither is this a case where the claimant has sought police protection in the past but has met with indifference, nor a case where the claimant has stated that similarly situated individuals have not been able to obtain police protection. It is a case where the claimant is afraid that the police cannot protect him. In Ferguson v. MCI32 the court stated:\n...the applicant made the decision not to press criminal charges against her husband because she was afraid of his reaction. This behaviour is understandable considering the circumstances but it does not make the state protection insufficient. A decision was made by the applicant not to use the system established by governmental authorities. If all victims of violent domestic abuse do not use the service offered, that system will never improve.\nIn the panel's view the same may be said in this case. While the panel acknowledges the fear of the claimant, this does not negate the existence of state protection. The objective documentation establishes that the police are making inroads against both organised crime and police corruption in Hungary and are both willing and able to offer state protection to the claimant. As to level of protection to be offered, the court in Zalzali33 referred to it as \"...adequate though not necessarily perfect.\"34 As noted by Mr. Justice Gibson in Smirnov v. Canada:35\nIt is a reality of modern-day life that protection offered is sometimes ineffective. Many incidents of harassment and\/or discrimination can be effected in a manner that renders effective investigation and protection very difficult. The use of unsigned correspondence that does not identify its source and of random telephone communications where the caller does not identify himself or herself are examples. A single incident of defacement of property is another. The applicants suffered from these types of incidents and received no satisfaction when they reported them to the militia or police. Random assaults, such as those suffered by the applicants, where the assailants are unknown to the victim and there are no independent witnesses are also difficult to effectively investigate and protect against. In all such circumstances, even the most effective, well-resourced and highly motivated police forces will have difficulty providing effective protection. This Court should not impose on other states a standard of \"effective\" protection that police forces in our own country, regrettably, sometimes only aspire to.\nIt is to be noted here that Mr. Justice Gibson is referring to a case where the claimants had sought state protection but it had not been successful. In the case at hand it has not even been established that the state cannot offer adequate protection to the claimant because the claimant did not seek it.\nUpon a consideration of the present claim the panel finds that this claimant has not advanced that \"clear and convincing proof\" of Hungary's inability to protect him that would be required to rebut the presumption that Hungary is capable of providing protection. The panel notes as well that there are no distinctive elements to the claims of XXXXX and XXXXXXX.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, I conclude that XXXXXXXXXX and his daughters XXXXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXXXX are not Convention refugees and not persons in need of protection and I therefore reject their claims.\n\"Michael A.

All four claimants say they have a well-founded fear of persecution and\/or are persons in need of protection.\nThere are potentially two countries of reference for the two adult claimants-- China, where they were born and have citizenship, and Peru, where they resided as permanent residents before coming to Canada.\nThe claimants fear racially motivated harassment, violence, threats to their lives, and interference with the children's education in Peru. The adult claimants also fear persecution on the basis of religion in China.\nThe principal claimant was designated as the representative for the two children for this proceeding.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe male adult claimant moved to Peru in 1985 and the female adult claimant moved there in 1988. They were married in China in 1984. They had two children in Peru, a son in 1989 and a daughter in 1991. The four claimants left Peru in 2001, and came to Canada where they made refugee claims.\nThe adult claimants owned and ran a restaurant in Lima, Peru. They say they were robbed many times by local Peruvian gangsters. These people had knives or guns, and took their money and told them to return to China. In XXXXX 2000 a Peruvian gang came into their restaurant and demanded money. The claimant and his wife were there. A kitchen helper, who was a relative, came out from the kitchen and one of the Peruvians shot him. He died later in hospital.\nThe adult claimants say they face harassment as well. People scold them in the streets and tell them to go home. Sometimes people refuse to sell goods to them as \"Chinos\". Their children were not liked at school and were bullied and badly treated, even though the parents spoke to the school authorities. All the children at the school were taken to the hospital for routine eye examinations, but these two children were not included because of their race. There was a national celebration day in Peru and all students were given special uniforms and hats for the parade - except these two children were not included because of their race. The children gave some evidence and said other students swear at them and bully them. They also said their teachers tell other students not to go to China because if they believe in Jesus Christ they will be killed in China. The two children have no friends at their school. The parents looked for other schools for the children but found conditions were the same in other schools.\nThe adult claimants say the police never assisted them with any of the robberies at the restaurant. They say some of the police are also thieves. After the shooting incident and death, the claimants decided they could no longer remain in Peru. They sold their restaurant and came to Canada.\nTheir counsel argued that the claimants were subject to crime because they are Asians. Counsel said the motivation for the crime is not money but race. The Minister's Representative said the claimants were the victims of discrimination but said the objective documentation shows there is no nexus. However, the Minister's Representative said he was most concerned about the children and the treatment they had received at school.\nThe adult claimants also make allegations regarding China, however I find it is not necessary to set out those allegations here.\nRegarding their status in Peru, the adult claimants say they were permanent residents in Peru and last paid their annual resident fee in 2001. The claimants are not sure if they can return to Peru because they failed to pay their resident fee for 2002. They think people are entitled to pay their fee late, but they are unsure of the consequences of paying late. They think the late fee might be an additional $20. They said they do not think there would be any barrier if they wanted to return to Peru. Their counsel said their right to return is conditional, as it is discretionary and they have to pay for it. Counsel says this involves an economic test.\nDETERMINATION\nI find the two adult claimants are excluded by Section 98 of the Act and Article 1E of the Convention,1 as they had permanent resident status in Peru, that status gave them the rights and obligations of a national of Peru, they have not lost those rights or have not shown they have lost the rights, and they do not have a well-founded fear of persecution based on race or nationality in Peru. Further I find they do not meet the definition of \"persons in need of protection\" in regard to Peru. As a result of these determinations, it is not necessary for me to make any determination regarding their claims against China.\nI find the two minor claimants do have a well-founded fear of persecution in Peru based on their race. This persecution is in relation to their education. These two claimants are not citizens of China and have never lived there, so there is no claim to be considered against China for the two minor claimants. Therefore, I find the two minor claimants are Convention refugees.\nANALYSIS - TWO ADULT CLAIMANTS\nArticle 1E2\nI find the two adult claimants are recognized by the authorities in Peru, where they resided as permanent residents for over ten years, as having the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of nationality in Peru.\nPermanent Resident Status\nWhile the adult male claimant was in Peru from 1985 to 2001, and the adult female claimant from 1988 to 2001, they had Immigrant Identity Cards and the status of permanent residents. An immigrant who moves to Peru can apply for an Immigrant Identity Card, which gives the person the status of permanent resident. With this status the person can continue to live in Peru indefinitely, provided they pay an annual fee and abide by certain laws.3\nImmigrants who are the age of majority can apply for Peruvian citizenship after two years of residency, if they meet certain language and other criteria. The claimants say they never applied for Peruvian citizenship.\nAccording to the claimants' evidence and country information on file, a person with permanent resident status can exit and re-enter Peru, live there, own property, work, own a business, and has the same access to educational services and health care as Peruvians. They also must pay taxes in the same way as Peruvians. However, the person is not allowed to vote in elections. The status is retained as long as the person complies with the requirements set out by legislative decree. This includes paying a modest annual fee. The status can be lost if the resident commits actions contrary to state security or public order, or does not have the economic means to support his or her residency, or has been sentenced by a Peruvian court for a crime. If a foreigner with permanent residence status fails to pay the annual fee or violates the terms of the decree, they can be subject to fines, forced exit, the cancellation of status as a resident, and\/or expulsion. However, the cancellation of residence status and expulsion requires a ministerial resolution following a recommendation of the Commission on the Status of Foreigners based on a police report issued by the Foreigner's Division of the National Police.4\nBased on the evidence and information on file, I find the Peruvian government recognizes that people who have been given an Immigrant Identity Card and permanent resident status in Peru have the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of nationality of Peru.5 It is not necessary for a person to have a right to vote to meet this requirement. As well, the potential for loss of status and expulsion is minimal and there are significant procedural protections in this regard. As noted above, the claimants had Immigrant Identity Cards and the status of permanent residents.\nNo Loss of Status\nThe claimants left Peru in 2001 and say they are unsure if they have the right to return there now. Their Immigrant Identity Cards show their annual fees were last paid for the year 2001. The claimants agreed with this information.\nAt this time, the claimants have been out of Peru for less than two years. Their annual fees were paid for the year 2001 and have not been paid for 2002 and 2003. From the documents on file referred to above, it is clear that the status of permanent resident in Peru is not easily lost. Immigrants who fail to pay the annual tax can be required to pay a fine to reinstate the currency of their Immigrant Identity Card. The state must take several significant steps to cancel the person's status. Based on all of this information and no evidence to the contrary, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the claimants have not lost their status of permanent residents in Peru and, at most, they would be required to pay a modest fine and the 2002 and 2003 annual fees to maintain their status.\nIn the alternative, having established that they had permanent resident status, the adult claimants have failed to produce evidence to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that they are not entitled to return to Peru and retain their status. Several Federal Court cases have said that once prima facie evidence has been presented to show a claimant had resident status and the right to return, the onus shifts to the claimant to show he or she cannot now return.6\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution in Peru\nWhile Section 98 and Article 1E make no reference to assessing whether the person in question has a well-founded fear of persecution or is a person in need of protection in the Article 1E country, I conclude these requirements are implicit in Article 1E7. That Article says a person must be recognized as having the \"rights and obligations\" of a national of the country. I am satisfied the rights of a national of a country include the right to be free from\npersecution on the basis of race, religion, nationality, political opinion, and membership in a particular social group, and the rights protected by section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Thus, this would apply to people, like the claimants, who have the status of permanent residents in Peru.\nThe adult claimants say they were victims of economic crime -- robbers wanted their money. They say they were not the victims of other crimes. They also say they faced discrimination and harassment. Some Peruvian shops refused to sell goods to them. The claimants say Peruvians do not like the Chinese as Peruvians feel the Chinese earn money in Peru and send it back to China. Their counsel argued the crime was motivated by race, but the facts provided by the claimants indicate the crime was perpetrated by robbers who wanted their money. I note the claimants gave evidence of three significant robberies in 13 years. Although the last incident was very traumatic, the total number of robberies they actually described is not very high for a crime-ridden city like Lima. I also note they were able to sell their restaurant to another Chinese person - so obviously other Chinese people were willing to operate a restaurant on the same premises.\nThe country documentation on file confirms that the crime rate in cities in Peru is high and gangs commit many crimes. Further, the police are often implicated, either by actually participating in the crimes or offering little protection from criminal acts and gangs. However, the country documentation does not support the claim that crimes are committed against the Chinese in Peru because of their race or nationality. Except for the unrest around the time of the 2000 election, the country documentation indicates that crime in Peru is primarily economically motivated.8 This is consistent with the claimants' evidence. The crime faced by the Chinese in Peru, including the lack of police protection, is faced generally by Peruvians. Therefore, based on the objective country documentation, I find there is no nexus or connection between the potential crime and lack of police protection faced by the claimants and their race or nationality. Further, I find this crime and the lack of police protection are problems faced generally by people in Peru; it is not personal to the claimants.\nI find the discrimination and harassment the claimants experienced on the street was likely racially motivated, but does not amount to persecution. The claimants say sometimes Peruvians would not sell goods to them, or would tell them to return to China. This family was part of a visible minority in Peru. Unfortunately, visible minorities in many countries often experience some harassment and discrimination. I find the incidents described by the claimants and in the country documentation in this regard are unpleasant but, neither individually nor cumulatively, do they amount to a systemic or persistent denial of basic human rights or human dignity.9\nIn conclusion, I find the adult claimants do not have a well-founded fear of persecution in Peru based on their race or ethnicity or any other ground in the Convention refugee definition. That is, there is less than a serious possibility they will suffer persecution in Peru due to their race or ethnicity or any other Convention ground. Based on the country documentation, I find there is a lack of nexus or connection between the more serious crime and the claimants' race or nationality. Further, I find the harassment and discrimination they face, while racially motivated, is not a systemic denial of human rights or human dignity. Thus, even considering the cumulative effect of all these racially motivated incidents, I find they do not amount to persecution.\nPerson in Need of Protection\nI also find the adult claimants do not meet the definition of \"persons in need of protection\" in Peru. They do face a significant risk of crime. However, the country documentation shows that people in many cities in Peru face the same level of crime, potential threats to their lives, and lack of police protection. Thus, while the claimants fear significant harm, this is a risk faced generally by other individuals in that country. It is not personal to the claimants in any way. It is a risk faced generally by citizens and residents in cities in Peru.\nTherefore, I find the adult claimants do not meet the definition of \"persons in need of protection\" because the risk they face is a risk faced generally by other individuals in Peru.\nANALYSIS - TWO MINOR CLAIMANTS\nAs the children were born in Peru, have Peruvian citizenship, have always lived in Peru and do not have Chinese citizenship, Peru is the only country of reference for their claims.\nI find the two minor claimants have been persecuted based on the treatment they received at school, and the requirements of the Act and the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.10\nThe evidence about the treatment of the children at school indicates they were singled-out and ostracized by the other students and by the teachers and other authorities at the school. They were harassed and bullied. They were excluded from routine eye examinations and from the national celebration - even though they were born and raised in Peru and speak Spanish. The teachers spoke very negatively about Chinese people and their values. The parents spoke to the teachers and other school authorities, but no action was taken. The children continued to be excluded and did not want to attend school. The parents looked for other schooling but did not find any place their children would receive better treatment.\nPersecution is not defined in the Act but is interpreted to mean \"serious harm\". This requires an analysis of the interest harmed and the extent to which the exercise of that interest has been compromised. In Ward,11 the Supreme Court said persecution will arise when actions deny human dignity in any key way. Persecution can be a single act, or the cumulative effect of a number of acts.\nSection 3(3) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act says the Act is to be construed and applied in a manner that complies with international human rights instruments to which Canada is a signatory. In Baker,12 the Supreme Court of Canada commented on the use of international instruments in the interpretation of Canadian law and noted that Canada has ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child although it has not been implemented.\nArticle 28 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child states that \"States Parties recognize the right of the child to education, with a view to achieving this progressively and on the basis of equal opportunity...\". Article 29 provides:\nStates Parties agree the education of the child shall be directed to: ... The development of respect for the child's parents, his or her own cultural identity, language and values, for the national values of the country in which the child is living, the country from which he or she may originate, and for civilizations different from his or her own; ... .\nArticle 30 states that:\nIn those States in which ethnic ... minorities exist, a child belonging to such minority ... shall not be denied the right with other members of his or her group, to enjoy his or her own culture ....\nI find the sustained and repeated acts faced by these children at their school were inconsistent with the principles set out in the Convention on the Rights of the Child and resulted in serious and sustained harm to these children. These children did not receive equal opportunity to education in Peru, their cultural identity and values were not respected, nor were they allowed to enjoy their culture. They were repeatedly harassed, sworn at, and belittled by classmates, but the teachers took no corrective action.\nI find the cumulative effect of these repeated acts amounted to persecution of these children on the basis of their race and ethnic origin. This was serious harm and involved a denial of human dignity in a key way. These acts fundamentally affected their education, which is essential to the development and well-being of a child. The state was complicit in this persecution as the school authorities were aware of the problem and did nothing to correct it. I am satisfied the parents were unable to find other schools where the children would receive better treatment. I find there is more than a mere possibility the two children would face the same kind of persecution if they returned to Peru.\nCONCLUSION\nI find the two adult claimants are excluded by Section 98 of the Act, as they have permanent resident status in Peru, which gives them the rights of a national of Peru, they have not lost those rights during their absence nor have they shown they cannot return to Peru, there is less than a serious possibility they will be persecuted in Peru based on their race or nationality or any other Convention ground, and they do not meet the definition of \"persons in need of protection\" in Peru. Thus, by virtue of Section 98 of the Act and Article 1E of the Convention, I find the two claimants are not Convention refugees and are not persons in need of protection.\nBased on these findings, it is not necessary to determine the adult claimants' claims against China.\nI find the two minor claimants do have a well-founded fear of persecution in Peru based on their race or ethnic origin, and no state protection is available and there is no Internal Flight Alternative.\nTherefore, based on all the evidence and submissions and the above reasons, the Convention Refugee Division determines:\n1. XXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXX are not Convention refugees and are not persons in need of protection, and\n2. XXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXX are Convention refugees.\n\"Thomas H. Kemsley\"\nThomas H.

The principal claimant and his wife and two minor children are all citizens of Uruguay. They bring their claims on the basis of a well-founded fear of persecution in Uruguay on the basis of an imputed anti-government political opinion. The principal claimant is a XXXX unionist and, as such, fears return to Uruguay because of his union activities. The father, XXXXXXXXX, is the designated representative for the two minor children, XXXXXXX and XXXXXXXX.\nWe heard testimony from the principal claimant and his wife, XXXXXX. The facts are essentially as follows. The principal claimant alleges that he became involved in registering and organizing a union for a XXXX called XXXX where he was employed as a XXXX XXXXX. It took approximately seven to eight months of organizing to establish a labour union at the XXXXX firm. Approximately 20 to 25 organizers were responsible for the creation of this union.\nAs a result of the organization by this group, the employer reacted with some harsh and discriminatory practices including the elimination of overtime (resulting in a 60 percent reduction in wages); no more annual incentives; employees being arbitrarily relocated to different branches and thereby incurring more expenses; ill-treatment and abuse by management including being yelled at and demoted; members being forced to sign contracts decreasing their wages and limiting their workload; AND employees being made to work longer hours than stipulated in the work code, yet only receiving pay for what the contract stipulates.\nIn addition, the claimant's truck was vandalized three times in one month, forcing him to stay home from work. On several occasions he found his locker open with his belongings strewn all over and pictures of his family crossed out. He began to receive telephone threats warning him against continued labour organization. His house was broken into and a written message in lipstick was left on a mirror saying, \"Do not come back to work or it will be worse!\"\nEventually threats were made against his small child, which created enormous tension in the household. The family was threatened by the possibility of marital breakdown as a result of the tension due to the principal claimant's labour activities.\nMrs. XXXXXXX had a nervous breakdown and almost miscarried their second child, XXXXXXXXX. They felt that the only solution to their stress and angst was to leave the country.\nOn XXXXX, 2000 the principal claimant left Uruguay and his wife joined him almost a year later. In XXXX 2001 the four claimants filed refugee claims alleging a well-founded fear of persecution in Uruguay.\nDETERMINATION\nI find that the claimants are not Convention refugees, as they do not have well-founded fears of persecution for a Convention ground in Uruguay. I also find that the claimants are not persons in need of protection in that their removal to Uruguay would not subject them personally to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment and punishment and in that there are no substantial grounds to believe that their removal to Uruguay will subject them personally to a danger of torture. My reasons are as follows.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\nThe claimants' identity as nationals of Uruguay has been established by their Uruguayan passports, identity documents and oral testimony. Consequently, I find that the claimants are all nationals of Uruguay and of no other country.\nCredibility\nI have found the claimants to be credible witness and, therefore, believe what they have alleged in support of their claims. The claimants testified in a straightforward and poignant manner and there were no material inconsistencies in their testimony or contradictions between their testimony and the other evidence before me. I am satisfied that the claimants have a bona fide subjective fear of returning to Uruguay. Their emotional testimony was very compelling. However, they have not rebutted the onus of providing that the state is unwilling and unable to protect them. I will have more to say about that below.\nReason for the Harm\nFor the claimants to be Convention refugees their fear of persecution must be \"by reason of\" one of the five grounds enumerated in the Convention refugee definition. I find that the claimants' fear of persecution is linked to one of the five grounds, namely, imputed political opinion.\nHarm Feared: Is it Persecution?\nThe claimants allege that should they return to Uruguay they would be subjected to the following harm, namely, harassment, discrimination, and threats to cause death, the cumulative effect of which amounts to persecution. Persecution has been defined as a \"sustained or systemic violation of fundamental rights.\"1 I find that the harm feared does violate a fundamental right. The rights affected are found in three international instruments, namely, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) at Article 22; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1996 (ICCPR), at Article 22; and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 1996 (ICESCR), at Article 8.\nSpecifically, in the UDHR at Article 20:\n(1): Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.\n(2): No one may be compelled to belong to an association.\nUnder the ICCPR the protected right is found in Article 22:\nparagraph (1): Everyone shall have the freedom of association with others, including the right to form and join trade unions for the protection of his interests.\nparagraph (2): No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of this right, other than those which are prescribed by law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, public order ...\nUnder the ICESCR the protected right may be found at Article 8:\nparagraph (1): The State's Parties to the present Covenant undertake to ensure:\n(a) the right of everyone to form trade unions and join the trade union of his choice, subject only to the rules of the organization concerned, for the promotion and protection of his economic and social interests. No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of this right other than those prescribed by law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public order or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\nThe protected rights under this Covenant include the right to establish national federations, the right to function freely subject to no limitations other than those prescribed by law and the right to strike. The fact that the claimant suffered discrimination and harassment as a result of his union activities, including the extreme mental and emotional pressure on the family, culminated in the nervous breakdown and depression of the claimant's wife, the high risk of miscarriage to the wife and the potential breakdown of the family unit.\nFor all of these reasons the family received psychiatric counselling and the wife was hospitalised in order to give birth to their second daughter long before her due date.\nThe claimant testified that he left the country because he had \"reached the limit.\" I, therefore, find that the death threats and harassment, together with the effect on the family, amount to persecution in this case.\nState Protection\nThe determinative issue before me was whether it was objectively unreasonable for the claimant to have sought state protection. While states are presumed to be capable of protecting their nationals, it was open to the claimant, according to the law, to rebut the presumption of protection with \"clear and convincing\"2 evidence.\nI find, on the evidence, that the claimant has not rebutted their presumption.\nI turn to Exhibit 43 Citizens of Uruguay have the right of freedom of association. Quote:\nThe Constitution states that laws should promote the organization of trade unions and the creation of arbitration bodies, however, there is almost no legislation concerning union activities. Unions traditionally organize and operate free of government regulation. Civil servants, employees of state-run enterprises, and private enterprise workers may join unions. Unionisation is high in the public sector (over 80 percent) and low in the private sector (under 5 percent). Labour unions are independent of political party control but traditionally have associated more closely with the broad front, the Leftist Political Coalition.\nIn addition, the Constitution provides workers with the right to strike and there are mechanisms for resolving workers' complaints against employers. Although unions have complained that these mechanisms are sometimes applied arbitrarily, there is a lack of evidence that this is a systemic problem.\nI note that the law generally prohibits discriminatory acts by employers, including arbitrary dismissal for union activities. Additionally, there are no laws prohibiting anti-union\ndiscrimination but in 1993 executive decree established fines for employers engaging in anti-union activities. While the law does not require employers to reinstate workers fired for union activities, in cases of legal challenges by union activities courts have tended to impose indemnization levels that are higher than those normally paid to dismissed workers.\nUruguay is a signatory to the International Labour Organizations governing body.4 The International Labour Organization (ILO) is the U.N. Special Agency, which seeks the promotion of social justice and internationally recognized human and labour rights. It was founded in 1919 and is the only surviving major creation of the Treaty of Versailles, which brought the League of Nations into being and it became the first specialized agency of the U.N. in 1946.\nILO formulates International Labour Standards in the form of Conventions, and recommendation setting minimum standards of basic labour rights: freedom of association, the right to organize, collective bargaining, abolition of forced labour, equality of opportunity and treatment, and other standards regulating conditions across the entire spectrum of work related issues. It also provides technical assistance.5\nFurthermore, the Uruguayan Ministry of Labour has a labour commission that investigates anti-union discrimination claims filed by union members. In 2000 there were five anti-union discrimination claims compared with 16 claims in 1999. All five cases were resolved and workers were rehired with full rights. Most complaints are resolved within a few months.6\nThe Research Directorate has indicated in a request for information that there are no references to a tax or harassment of union members or leaders to be found among the sources\nconsulted by the Research Directorate.7 Further research conducted by the Research Director resulted in a letter from SERPAJ SERVICIO (a non-governmental organization having consultative status with the United Nations [ECOSOC and UNESCO].\nIn this letter from the National Coordinator I read the following:\nA union member, like anyone else who feels that his rights have been violated, can apply to the judicial authorities to complain and seek protection. There is no special procedure for this purpose; the ordinary processes must be followed. As in any judicial process, legal representation is required. This is a summary judicial process for the protection of rights. However, in practice it is very rarely applied because it is subordinate to other judicial resources. Also, under Uruguayan labour law, the self-governing authorities of labour organizations must not be overlooked. They have a strong tradition in our country.\nAnd, finally, in confirmation of the claimant's testimony the Research Directorate responded to a special request for information with respect to this case and found that:\nDevoto was the first supermarket chain in Uruguay to form a workers' union in July 1999 called the Sindicato Unico de Empleados de Devoto (SUED). 8\nThis Response to Information Request indicates that while certain unionists were harassed, there were no reports of attacks.\nFinally, the claimant testified that many of the organizers of the union are still employed by XXXX and still living in Uruguay without difficulty. In looking to the\ncircumstances of similarly situated individuals, the claimant could not provide evidence of individuals who would suffer persecutory consequences and a consequent lack of state protection in similar circumstances to his. In fact, those similarly situated to the claimant, that is, those currently employed by XXXX and involved in organizing trade union activities, have not left the country, nor have they experienced any personal harm to the claimant's knowledge.\nCONCLUSION\nIt is my determination the claimants do not have a well-founded fear of persecution, in that, they have not rebutted the presumption that the state of Uruguay is able and willing to protect them from any persecutory acts of its citizens.\nWhile the claimants did make a report to the police, which is filed at Exhibit 6.2, there was a lack of follow up on their part. They felt that the police did not act in their best interest. However, I note that a report was lodged and two police officers did attend their home when their house was broken into. The claimants did not report the telephone threats or the death threats. They did not follow up with any senior police officers, nor did they make any complaints to any of the state governing union bodies or the Department of Labour. Their failure to do this is fatal to their claim with respect to state protection. They have an obligation to seek state protection if state protection is reasonably forthcoming, which I find it is in this case.\nI would be remiss if I did not comment on the credibility of the claimants. I found their testimony extremely compelling and touching. They did not embellish their evidence in any way. In fact, the truthfulness of their evidence worked against them in this case in the sense that they could not point to similar situated individuals who had attempted to invoke state protection, to no avail.\nWe do not have the ability to make a positive determination on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. This is left to another decision maker and it is my hope that those persons charged with that task will look favourably upon these individuals who so obviously fear return to Uruguay.\nFor the foregoing reasons I conclude that XXXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX are not Convention refugees and not persons in need of protection. I, therefore, reject their claims.\n\"Paulah Dauns\"\nPaulah Dauns\nMay 7, 2003\nDate\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - PERSECUTION - POLITICAL OPINION - UNION - STATE PROTECTION - MALE - FEMALE - NEGATIVE - URUGUAY\n1 Canada (Attorney General) v.

His wife, XXXXXXXXXX, 37 years of age, bases her claim on her husband's and the fact that she signed an undertaking to report him if he returned home to Basra. Their three minor daughters, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, aged 14, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, aged 13, and XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, aged 7, all base their claims on those of their parents. A son, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, was a minor when he made his refugee claim but now has reached age 18. He bases his claim on military service evasion. XXXXXXXXXX is the children's Designated Representative.\nSUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS\nAccording to the principal claimant's Personal Information Form and amendments,1 he is a Shi'a Muslim from Iraq. The family lived in Basra and he was XXXXX with his brother of two farms, also located in southern Iraq.\nHis refugee claim and the claims of his wife and minor daughters all hinge on the fact that he joined a public protest against the regime on XXXX, 1999. This was three weeks after the assassination of the leading Shi'a cleric, Ayatollah Mohammad Sadeq Al-Sadr. He managed to escape the authorities and soon fled to XXXX, in northern Iraq, which is under Kurdish control. Soon after the incident, the authorities came to his home in Basra and made his wife sign an undertaking to report him if he returned. According to the narrative statement in her husband's PIF and her own,2 she and the children remained in the south, moving between the houses of relatives in Basra and Baghdad. She took her son, XXXX out of school.\nThe principal claimant and his wife communicated by letters sent via a taxi driver who worked between Mosul and Baghdad.\nIn XXXXX 1999 they learned that the farms had been confiscated. According to his wife's oral testimony - there is no mention of this in the PIFs -- she then got in touch with a cousin who knew someone in security and was informed there was an arrest warrant for her husband. She asked her cousin to obtain the arrest warrant because she wanted to know the sentence - whether it would be just a fine or a jail term - and on XXXXX, 1999 she got a copy by bribery in the sum of one million Iraqi dinars. She then took the document to her brother, a XXXXX in Iraq, who verified its authenticity. Although she told her husband about the arrest warrant, she did not sent the copy to him.\nThe principal claimant's wife and their three minor daughters and teenage son, XXXX, joined him in northern Iraq after she succeeded in selling their house in Basra. Three months later they left Iraq and transited Turkey, Mexico and the US before arriving in Canada by taxi on August 31, 2001. They made refugee claims at the border.\nThe principal claimant's son, XXXX, states in his PIF3 that he refuses to serve in the military in Iraq because he does not want to contribute to the killing of innocent people.\nISSUES\nThe issues identified in the claims included: personal identity; ethnicity (Shi'a Muslim); credibility; discrimination versus persecution (on the basis of being Shi'a alone); prosecution versus persecution; failure to claim elsewhere (in the US en route to Canada); and, with respect to the Consolidated Grounds, generalized risk and severity of pain\/suffering. XXXX military service evasion was mentioned briefly in the narrative statement of his own PIF (written by his father) but emerged as a live issue during the hearing when he testified on his own behalf.\nANALYSIS\nPersonal Identity\nEach of the claimants adduced a \"duplicate\" Personal Identity Card4 issued by the Republic of Iraq. With the exception of the youngest minor claimant these cards display a photograph of the holder. According to the translations, the cards belonging to the adult claimants were issued to them in XXXX 1992 and those for the youngest child in XXXX 1999 and for the older children in XXXXX 1999. The cards are all in pristine condition but the photographs are outdated relative to the age of the claimants are the time of issuance.\nThe principal claimant and his wife also provided a copy of their marriage contract. They did not provide the Iraqi passports listed on the PIF. Nor did the family offer any other incidental evidence of their lives in Iraq, such as school records or bank accounts or proof of property ownership and sale - despite the fact that their house in Basra supposedly was sold to finance their escape and the principal claimant was XXXXX of a farm that allegedly was confiscated by the government. Numerous members of the family remain in Iraq, including the principal claimant's siblings, his wife's mother and siblings; and their eldest daughter, XXXXX, all of whom potentially could have helped obtain such evidence for them.\nThe Refugee Protection Division is not satisfied with the explanations given by the principal claimant and his wife for the odd physical features of the personal identity cards, or the notion that these were used regularly over the course of years to secure rations in Iraq. These documents and other evidence raise the possibility that this family may have spent time in another English-speaking country before coming to Canada (and thus have acquired status somewhere else), although apparently not in the US since the USINS says it has no record of them in that country.5 They gave different dates for their departure from Iraq even though allegedly they all traveled together and the trip was carefully planned in advance. The principal claimant and his son know\nthe English language. As set out below, the Refugee Protection Division finds there are serious reasons to doubt the credibility of their allegations about the incident in XXXX 1999, which is the lynchpin of the claims. Yet even if it were true, the alleged events of the next two years appear contrived to fill the time span until their arrival in Canada in August 2001.\nCertainly many Iraqis have left their country. According to an estimate by the U.S. Committee For Refugees, between 1 and 2 million Iraqis living outside the country are believed to have a well-founded fear of persecution if they returned, although only about 300,000 had any formal recognition as refugees or asylum seekers in 2001.6\nStill, the identity documents provided by the claimants, coupled with their evident knowledge of Iraq, satisfy the issue of personal identity for the purposes of assessing their refugee claims.\nEthnic Group (Shi'a or Shite Muslim)\nThe principal claimant provided a \"Certificate\" signed by members of the Muslim Education and Welfare Foundation of Canada that certifies he is a Shiite Muslim.7 He gave a credible account of how this document was obtained.\nDuring the hearing he was asked to name the twelve Imams of the Shi'a branch of Islam. While he did not get a perfect score by any means,8 he did well enough to demonstrate further that he is a Shi'a Muslim, albeit not an overly religious man, as counsel summed it up in his oral submissions.\nThe Refugee Protection Division finds that the XXXXXXX family is Shi'a Muslim.\nCredibility\nThe principal claimant was not a credible witness concerning his alleged participation in a Shia demonstration in XXXX 1999, upon which his own refugee claim and those of his wife and daughters entirely depend.\nHis narrative statement in the PIF, with amendments, states:\nIn February 1999 the assassination of the Shiite religion scholar Mr. Mohammed Sadiq Al Sedder took place. At that time and next 3 weeks in March 1999, I was praying with his supporter in the mosque of Al Ghafeer (amended to Al-Faqeer) in old Basra...In the third Friday of March of 1999 a lot of prayers went on to the street to denounce the Ba'th members doings - the killings of religious scholars. Some of the religious young people started to destroy the criminal Saddam's pictures and started to attack the Ba'th center. Some of the young people were armed. They had automatic gun machines \"Kalashnikov.\" (Last sentence deleted in an amendment.) The others had sticks and rocks. When we heard about it, we came out from the mosque to support them against the regime. We started to shout slogans as \"Death To Saddam\" and destroyed Saddam's pictures. We entered the Ba'th center and public militia (clarified as meaning People's Army, in the amendment). This event happened without prior planning, but we felt a sense of responsibility and duty to our country and fellow demonstrator. We knew that the Ba'th leaders were doing against the people of Iraq and particularly the Shi'at. After a few hours the republican guards entered the streets and started to gunfire toward the citizens without distinguishing. They killed who ever they could. The rest of the people escaped. They went after people who escaped. I was one of them. I was able to escape the criminal Saddam's gun forces...9\nA calendar in evidence shows the third Friday in March 1999 was March 19th. Numerous authoritative documents, including those provided by counsel, show that this incident spanned three or four days; it started on night of March 17-18 and lasted until March 20.10\nWhen the principal claimant testified he incorporated this additional information into his story as if it were his own. He admitted, however, that he had not known the demonstration had been going on for two days when he supposedly got involved. His explanation was that earlier he was working far away and was not at home in Basra. The Refugee Protection Division finds it is not\ncredible that he would have failed to hear about what happened on the night of March 17-18 when he came into Basra for Friday prayers at the large mosque. He has embellished his story to take account of the chronology in documentary material disclosed in advance of his hearing.\nHis description of the March 1999 incident is at odds with reports in the documentary evidence about the nature of the protest. The sources refer to a \"wide spread revolt\" and \"armed riots\" and that \"armed groups carried out a large operation.\" The Iraqi government apparently identified the perpetrators as Iranian Revolutionary Guards who had crossed the border disguised as civilians to carry out the acts of sabotage.11 Other reports say they were \"armed Iraqi Shi'a Islamists, some of whom were reportedly sent by Iraqi Shi'a opposition groups based in Iran.\" Several government officials were killed in the attack on the local Ba'ath Party headquarters. This objective information contrasts with the principal claimant's fairly tame description of the event as a \"demonstration\" and a \"march\" where participants shouted political slogans and tore up pictures of Saddam Hussein and insulted him. The Refugee Protection Division prefers the general description in the objective evidence.\nIn part, this is because the principal claimant gave a very different account of his actions to Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) when he made his refugee claim. According to the Immigration Officer's notes of the interview, he said that,\nWe targeted the popular army positions\/police stations (and) tried to kill as many Ba'ath members we can - the army intervened and army started shelling us with live ammunition.12\nHe recanted this version at the hearing, saying that he was not really trying to kill anyone but rather to get rid of Saddam.\nWhen questioned about the putative arrest warrant in his name,13 the principal claimant stated that the \"the law that condemned me death\" was \"law 124.\" He was asked whether he was sure about the number and he said he thought so and ventured that anyone who insults the President will be condemned to death. According to the translation of the putative arrest warrant, his offense was: \"Rioting and Humiliation of the President (Penal Code 214).\" When confronted with this evidence, he said he did not know anything about this law and he was never concerned about law before this happened to him and he did not interfere in politics. This response is not credible in view of the extraordinary efforts his wife allegedly took to get a copy of the arrest warrant to show him and the fact that her brother is the XXXXX who supposedly verified the contents for her. The Refugee Protection Division notes that no objective information could be found by the Refugee Protection Officer about the existence of Section 214 of the Penal Code14 and that the photocopy provided is of very poor quality and thus subject to falsification. Considering all these factors, the Refugee Protection Division finds, on the balance of probabilities, that the document is not reliable or trustworthy.\nAs the principal claimant repeatedly said, he had no history of political protest as a Shi'a Muslim. He served in the Iraqi army during the war against Iran (a Shi'a nation) and lived in Basra during the 1991 Shi'a uprising there following the Gulf War, but did not take part. (His explanation is that US forces prevented him from leaving his farm.) Apparently he is also a careful man, given that it supposedly took him two whole years to arrange for the family to flee Iraq. Thus the Refugee Protection Division finds it would have been out of character to spontaneously participate in a risky public protest against the regime for its killing of the Shi'a cleric, Ayatollah Mohammad Sadeq Al-Sadr. His claim that he had finally \"had enough,\" does not have the ring of truth, particularly if he knew the mosque had been full of Saddam's security agents and they had spilled out onto the street too. (Allegedly he is sure they identified him both in the mosque and at the street demonstration.)\nThe objective information is that the Iraqi authorities responded swiftly and brutally with the rioters. According to one source:\n...As soon as government forces regained control of Basra on 20 March the repression started with dozens of people executed following torture and hundreds of others arrested and tortured.15\nIn this context, the Refugee Protection Division finds it difficult to believe that the authorities would have behaved in a somewhat civilized manner by issuing a \"top secret\" arrest warrant for the claimant and confiscating farm property, and that if they knew of his involvement, they failed to track him down in northern Iraq, where the government is known to have spies.\nThe Refugee Protection Division concludes that the principal claimant did not participate in a anti-government protest on XXXX, 1999 as alleged and his alleged fear of persecution for this reason is not credible. It follows that the claims for Convention refugee status or protected person status of his wife and his daughters, which directly depend on his story, also fail on the issue of credibility.\nMilitary Service Evasion\nAt the time of this decision, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX has reached 18 years of age. Military service in Iraq is obligatory for male citizens of Iraq who are 18 years of age or older. Iraq does not have an alternative service for those who are conscientious objectors or who are unwilling to perform military service. If an Iraqi male citizen refuses to perform the obligatory service, he will be tried before a military tribunal and, as punishment, will receive a prison sentence. 16\nThe claimant left the country when he was still too young to think about what he would do to avoid conscription, according to his oral testimony.\nHe said the reason he does not want to serve in Saddam's armed forces is that they torture and kill innocent people. He admits that his opinion has been influenced by what he has seen in the western media.\nThe documentary evidence on military service in Iraq indicates that on the face of it there may be various ways to obtain deferrals or exemptions, by means of cash payment and\/or being a student. What is chilling, however, in view of Saddam Hussein's history of ad hoc decrees on military service, is that he has the ultimate power to grant exemptions.17 For similar reasons, little is known about the precise penalties for draft evasion.\nWhile there is information to suggest that conscription in the central Iraqi army is not enforced in the semi-autonomous Kurdish provinces in northern Iraq,18 the claimant would have to be able to access this IFA without going through Baghdad. It is by no means clear to the Refugee Protection Division whether he could do so in the present circumstances. According to the information in disclosure, from early 2002:\n...The (joint Danish\/British) delegation were informed that if someone wishes to return to northern Iraq voluntarily the KDP and PUK request a very detailed form to be completed plus a voluntary return form. They ensure that the person understands what he\/she is signing. The form is sent to IOM (International Organization for Migration) in Ankara who in turn start the clearance process. The IOM staffs see the returnee across the Iraqi border without any problems.19\nBut that procedure may not be operating currently as countries in the region prepare for a war against Iraq.20 Moreover, as counsel pointed out in his oral submissions at the hearing, there is more than a mere possibility that such a war would effectively eliminate any chances the claimant might otherwise have to avoid compulsory military service in Iraq.\nThe Refugee Protection Division accepts counsel's argument that the Federal Court of Appeal decisions in Zolfagharkhani21 and Al-Maisr22 apply to the facts of this refugee claim. In both cases, the Court held that the Board should have been guided by paragraph 171 of the UNHCR Handbook. It reads as follows:\nNot every conviction, genuine though it may be, will constitute a sufficient reason for claiming refugee status after desertion or draft-evasion. It is not enough for a person to be in disagreement with his government regarding the political justification for a particular military action. Where, however, the type of military action, with which an individual does not wish to be associated, is condemned by the international community as contrary to the basic rules of human conduct, punishment for desertion or draft-evasion could, in the light of all other requirements of the definition, in itself be regarded as persecution. (Emphasis added.)23\nThe claimant fears that he would be forced to participate in the murder and torture of civilian non-combatants, which would be contrary to internationally recognized human rights principles. Counsel cites as the instruments in this respect, the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment of Punishment; Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners; and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.24\nThe Refugee Protection Division concludes that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of his conscientious objection to military service in Iraq.\nDiscrimination Versus Persecution (Based On Being Shi'a Muslim Only)\nHaving found that this family is Shi'a Muslim, the question remains as to whether on this basis alone they would fit the Definition of Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.\nHaving reviewed the documentary material and the claimants oral evidence that they had no problems living in Iraq before the alleged XXXX 1999 incident, the Refugee Protection Division agrees with counsel's assessment that the mere fact they are Shi'a is not itself a sufficient basis for the claims. Rather, it is religious leaders and their supporters who are the victims of religious oppression in Iraq.25\nDETERMINATION\nFor all the reasons above, the Refugee Protection Division finds that the principal claimant, his wife and three minor daughters, have failed to provide sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish their claims as Convention refugees or protected persons. Accordingly, the Refugee Protection Division determines that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, his wife, XXXXXXXXXX, and their minor daughters, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, and XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. However, the Refugee Protection Division finds that the principal claimant's son has established his sur place claim based on military service evasion. Accordingly, the Refugee Protection Division determines that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is a Convention refugee.\n\"Barbara Hodgins\"\nBarbara Hodgins\nMarch 7, 2003\nDate\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - CREDIBILITY - PERSECUTION - PERSON IN NEED OF PROTECTION - MILITARY SERVICE - REFUGEE SUR PLACE - MALE - FEMALE - NEGATIVE - POSITIVE - IRAQ\n1 Exhibit 1.1 and 1.2.\n2 Exhibit 2.\n3 Exhibit 3.\n4 Exhibit 5, Book of Documents tab 1-page 1, tab 2-page 4, tab 3-page 7, tab 4-page 10, tab 5-page 13 and tab 6-page 16.\n5 Exhibit 10.\n6 Exhibit 7, Worldwide Refugee Information, Country Report: Iraq 2002.\n7 Exhibit 11.\n8 Exhibit 15.2, A Short History of the Lives of The Twelve Imams.\n9 Supra, footnote 1, Lines 1-21 of the original narrative statement and narrative amendments made April 5, 2002.\n10 Exhibit 8, IRQ39404.

XXXXX, age 15, and XXXXX XXXX, age 13, are her sons. They claim they have a well-founded fear of persecution in China and fear a risk to their lives, a risk of cruel and unusual punishment or treatment, and a danger of torture in China. Specifically, Ms. XXXXX husband is in jail for protesting against expropriation of their property without fair compensation, and Ms. XXX fears arrest and detention by the Chinese authorities for herself and deprivation of an education for her sons. The claim is based on membership in a particular social group. Ms. XXX was the designated representative for the two minor claimants at the hearing.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe primary claimant and her husband were married in 1985. In 1998 they spent their life savings and built a home on land the government had leased to them. In 2001 the government demanded they remove their house as the land was being expropriated for road widening. The same thing was happening to other people in their area. Her husband and others organized a protest. He and four others were arrested, convicted and sentenced to jail for three years. In 2001 the government demolished their house. The two children were suspended from school because of their father's political activities and imprisonment.\nDETERMINATION\nI find Ms. XXXXX is not a Convention refugee and is not a person in need of protection. I find the two minor claimants are Convention refugees based on their membership in a particular social group. Their father is a political activist and they are being denied an education as a consequence.\nANALYSIS\nMs. XXXXX\nWhen Ms. XXXXX fled China, her husband was in prison, but nothing had happened to her personally. She was living with her father-in-law, and still working. She produced a summons, but I am satisfied that summons relates to a demand for her to give evidence in her husband's case. It is not a summons for any political activity on her part, and she said she was not involved in the political protest. As her husband has gone to jail for three years, I am satisfied she would no longer be required to appear to give evidence in her husband's trial. As she was not involved in any political action and apparently was living openly before she left China, I find the authorities are not very interested in her. As a result, I find there is less than a serious possibility she will face persecution on any Convention ground, or a risk to her life or a risk of cruel and unusual punishment or treatment, or a danger of torture if she returns to China.\nMinor claimants\nI find these two claimants are in a different situation from their mother. They were suspended from school when their father was imprisoned.1 They were not able to return to school during the time they remained in China. There is some uncertainty about whether their father will be released. Hence there is some uncertainty about whether they will ever be able to return to school. This is based on their family membership, as they are being denied permission to go to school because of their father.\nI find the two minor claimants have been persecuted based on their suspension from school, and the requirements of the Act and the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.2\nPersecution is not defined in the Act but is interpreted to mean \"serious harm\". This requires an analysis of the interest harmed and the extent to which the exercise of that interest has been compromised.\nSection 3(3) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act says the Act is to be construed and applied in a manner that complies with international human rights instruments to which Canada is a signatory. In Baker,3 the Supreme Court of Canada commented on the use of international instruments in the interpretation of Canadian law and noted that Canada has ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child although it has not been implemented.\nArticle 28 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child states that \"States Parties recognize the right of the child to education, with a view to achieving this progressively and on the basis of equal opportunity...\". It further provides States Parties shall \"Make primary education compulsory and available free to all;\" ... and shall \"Take measures to encourage regular attendance at schools and the reduction of drop-out rates.\"\nI find the extended suspension of these two children from their school and the uncertainty about whether they will be able to return to school are inconsistent with the principles set out in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and have resulted in serious and sustained harm to these children. These children were denied primary education in China, through no fault of their own. I find this fundamentally affected their education, which is essential to the development and well-being of a child. This was done by state school authorities. It was based on the children's relationship to their father.\nWhile it is speculative as to whether or not their father will soon be released and, if he is released, whether these children will be able to return to school, I am satisfied there is more than a mere possibility these children will face persecution through a denial of their education based on their membership in a particular social group if they return to China.\nCONCLUSION\nBased on all the evidence, submissions and above analysis, the Refugee Protection Division determines XXXXXXXX is not a Convention refugee and is not a person in need of protection.\nBased on the evidence, submissions and above analysis, the Refugee Protection Division determines XXXXXXX and XXXXXXX are Convention refugees.\n\"Thomas H.

He claims to be a person in need of protection because he would be subjected personally to a risk to his life, or to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Colombia. He seeks refugee protection pursuant to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.1\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant alleged the following: He was employed as a XXXXXXXX in Cali, and from XXXXX 2001 he performed XXXXXXX within the XXXXXXXXXXX de Cali complex. One night in XXXXX 2001, while performing XXXXXXXXX, he was confronted by several masked individuals brandishing submachine guns and wearing uniforms he recognised as being from the popular militia, or subgroup of FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), a well-known guerrilla group. He was beaten and his money was stolen. They threatened to kill him. The following day he filed a formal complaint with the municipal police department.2 Three days later, while going to work in the early morning hours, he was chased by three masked men wearing similar clothing to those who had attacked him earlier. He could not say whether they were the same men who attacked him. He ran and managed to get away from these three men.\nDeciding it was unsafe for him to remain in his home area of Cali, he moved away, eventually leaving the country. He entered the USA in California, as a stowaway on a ship from Panama. He was apprehended and detained while awaiting his asylum determination by the immigration courts. He was detained four months, and released, pending a resolution of his asylum claim. He decided to come to Canada before his case was decided in the USA.\nHe believes his name is on a list of wanted persons, by FARC and informs the panel he has heard this from his family in Cali. They have advised him that the popular militia have come looking for the claimant, several times at his home in Cali. He fears they will kill him because they believe he is a police informant.\nDECISION\nI find that the claimant is not a person in need of protection in that his removal to Colombia would not subject him personally to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. My reasons are as follows.\nANALYSIS\nThe claimant came across as generally credible, although I have some questions regarding his subjective fear, given the choices he made to come to Canada rather than await the outcome of his asylum claim in the US. I do note that his story has remained more or less consistent from the time he made his asylum claim in the USA, to the claim made to Canada Immigration, written in his PIF3 and his oral testimony. It is a very simple story, without a lot of detail.\nHe believes that by filing a denunciation with the police, he has been targeted as an \"informant\" by FARC, and that his risk has been increased thereby. I note this denunciation was made XXXX, 2001, almost two years ago. The claimant could not identify his attackers, although he did say that he suspected they were from FARC. He did not name any particular individual to the police. There are many members of FARC in Colombia. Why would they be interested in a generic complaint against them that does place any particular member at risk? The claimant could not explain why he believed this was the case, except for the alleged \"calls\" his mother told him about. In my opinion, he is speculating when he concludes that he is at personal risk.\nIn addition, the claimant did not report the second incident when he was chased, three nights after the attack. He did not provide any new information to the police as to why he assumed they thought he was an \"informant.\" He speculated further that it was because he was employed as a security guard with the Ministry of Defence. This was not alleged in his PIF or his US asylum claim.4 In my view, two incidents, three days apart, does not make a case for a risk to life, without more.\nThe \"more\" being alleged, are the calls from his mother, and the list she sent, (allegedly from FARC) which has his name included on it.5 The list is not on letterhead, does not say who is its' author, is not dated, and could easily have been typed by anyone. There are no seals, stamps, or security features. It is a very primitive document. It has no probative value and I therefore give it no weight. I note in addition that the claimant was never the victim of any previous attacks by FARC or anyone else. I can therefore not draw any conclusions about FARC's interest in him, beyond the two incidents alleged.\nIn addition, the police complaint is suspect. The letterhead appears to have been photocopied and there are no official stamps on the report. It is a report confirming a complaint was previously made. A copy of the original complaint was not attached. The last line of the report has been erased with \"white-out\" and new words added. I give very little weight to this questionable document, therefore. I accept it is evidence of the fact that he filed a complaint XXXX, 2001.\nMoreover, the claimant made an asylum claim in the US. Rather than await the outcome, he chose to come to Canada and file a refugee claim here. He was safe in the US and had been released pending the outcome of his case. His explanation does not make sense. He testified it was because he was afraid he would be detained once again. His departure speaks to a lack of subjective fear.\nAnother problem with his claim involves the fact he makes no mention of his uncle being shot on XXXXX, 2001, although his PIF was signed December 18, 2001. He attempted to explain this omission by saying his mother had not informed him of his uncle's death because she did not know him (he was her husband's brother). This is significant because the claimant relies upon his uncle's death to establish the fact he is a \"similarly situated individual\". I do not believe the claimant was unaware of his uncle's death at the time he wrote his PIF, or shortly thereafter. Also, he did not amend the PIF to include his uncle's death, prior to the hearing. The fact he did not, suggests to me that he did not appreciate the significance his uncle's death might make to his own refugee claim, yet he attempted to use it to bolster his claim later on, at the hearing. He is drawing a parallel between his uncle's death by guerrillas and the guerrillas looking for the claimant.\nIn addition, he notes in his PIF6 that the first time he learned why he was being targeted by FARC, was after he arrived in Canada October 24, 2001. I note his asylum claim in the USA specifically uses the word \"informant\" several times.7\nThe claimant has not established that what he fears is not generalized risk. According to section 97(1)(b)(ii) of the Act, protection on the basis of a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment is limited to those who face a specific risk not faced generally by others in or from the country. The risk must not be an indiscriminate or random one faced by the claimant and others.8 Given the high incident of criminal acts in Colombia, and that random crime is rampant, the claimant has not established the risk is personal to him, and not a general risk experienced by the population of Colombia.\nI have considered whether a viable Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) exists for the claimant, as this issue was raised with the claimant both before and at the hearing. On the evidence before me, I find that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being subjected to a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Bogata, Medellin, or San Andres State. In reviewing the country documentation filed, the claimant has not rebutted the onus upon him to establish he does not have an accessible IFA to for example, Bogata, Medellin (both large, metropolitan areas) or San Andres State, which is the only one of Colombia's 32 states where FARC guerrillas are not active.9 While it is true that FARC guerrillas operate virtually throughout Colombia, we do not have evidence they are aware of the claimant specifically, or know his name.\nThe claimant is speculating when he concludes the fact he was not a victim of random violence, which is what I have concluded took place in this case, makes him a target of FARC throughout the country of Colombia. He has travelled through Panama, to the USA and on to Canada, using his own devices to do so, even though he did not speak English. He could put to good use these same skills to move to another part of Colombia. Having considered the conditions in Bogata, Medellin, and San Andres State, and all the circumstances of this case, including those particular to the claimant, I find that it is not objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek refuge in another part of Colombia for the reasons stated.\nThe claimant has not advanced any evidence of a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason, and I find none on the evidence before me. In addition, he has not alleged he is a person in need of protection because he would be subjected personally to a danger of torture, and I find none on the evidence advanced.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, I conclude that XXXXXXXXXXXXX is not a Convention refugee and not a person in need of protection and I therefore reject his claim.\n\"Paulah Dauns\"\nPaulah Dauns\nMay 8, 2003\nDate\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - PERSON IN NEED OF PROTECTION - SUBJECTIVE ELEMENT - INTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE - GENERALIZED RISK - RISK TO LIFE -MALE - NEGATIVE - COLOMBIA\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Exhibit 9 is a report of a complaint having been made on XXXX, 2001 to the municipal police in XXXXX, which describes an attack, dated XXXXX, 2001.

The claimants arrived in Vancouver on XXXXX 2001 and made a claim to be a Convention refugee on 24 August 2001. The hearing into the claim was held pursuant to section 170 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA),1 at Vancouver, B.C. on 19 February 2003.\nThe female claimant was made the designated representative of the two minor claimants. In determining whether the claimants are Convention refugees or persons in need of protection, I have considered all the evidence, including the claimant's Personal Information Form (PIF),2 oral testimony, the documentary evidence filed by counsel, the Refugee Protection Officer (RPO), and the Minister's Representative, all submissions, IRPA, and the relevant caselaw.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe principal claimant's PIF alleges that he is a Tamil raised and educated in Jaffna. In 1980, he commenced employment in the XXXXXXXX in Kandy. In 1981, he met and married his wife, who comes from a traditional Buddhist Sinhalese family.\nIn 1983 he commenced work for XXXXXXXXXXXX. At that time, the operation was owned by XXXXXXXXXXX, who handed over the XXXX to XXXXXXXXX in 1985. XXXXX died in 1994 and was followed by XXXXXXX. The claimant rose to be XXXXXX of XXXXXX and XXXXXXX for the XXXXXXXX enterprises.\nAmong the many businesses XXXXXX was involved in was arms trading for the Sri Lankan Government. In October 2000, XXXXXX procured the contract for purchasing sophisticated arms to the Sri Lankan army. XXXXXX stood to make large profits.\nIn XXXX 2001, members of the Tamil Tigers threatened the claimant. They wished to know details of the arms shipments, mode of transport, and shipping dates. He advised them that he knew nothing and had no access to information like that. They did not believe him.\nHe believes he was targeted because he was the highest-ranking Tamil in XXXXXX business. In addition, he believes that the Tigers assumed that his position as XXXXXX and XXXXXXXXX for the XXXX, the principal company in XXXXXXX existing empire, would have given him access to complete information.\nThough he was terrified of the Tigers, he was more afraid to report the matter to the police and incur Tiger retribution. He feared that, after that, the Tigers would wreak their vengeance on him and his family no matter where he was in Sri Lanka.\nHe believed that time might solve the problem. But the threats persisted through XXXX and XXXX, making him more and more worried. He considered himself to be in a hopeless situation. The family had planned a vacation to Canada since January 2001 and went ahead with their plans. He applied for visas to Canada and left Sri Lanka on XXXXX 2001. He remained in XXXX XXXXXXX employ and XXXXXX had asked him to continue checking in on the XXXX. Therefore, he called his office on XXXX 2001, three days after arriving in Vancouver and discovered that the police had called to say that his house had burned down. His parents also told him that they were contacted in Jaffna by the LTTE wondering how to get in touch with him. He believed that the Tigers had shown him their vengeance. He believes that he and his family could be victims of further reprisals. Upon finding out that his house had been torched, the family made refugee claims in Vancouver, August 24.\nISSUES\nThe issues in the claim were nexus, credibility, delay, change in circumstances, Internal Flight Alternative (IFA), state or de facto protection, Article 1F(a), and Article 1F(b).\nANALYSIS\nCredibility and Objective Basis\nIn assessing the credibility of the claimant, I am guided by the following principles established by the Federal Court. Unless it is rebutted, a claimant's sworn testimony is presumed to be true.3 However, the Board is entitled to disbelieve that testimony and base its decision on that assessment provided it gives its reasons in clear and unmistakable terms.4 The Board is entitled to base its credibility assessment on such grounds as internal contradictions, inconsistencies, evasions,5 implausibility,6 omissions,7 rationality, and common sense.8 Documentary evidence may be preferred to the claimant's testimony on the basis that the sources were reputable and independent and had no interest in the outcome of the particular claim.9 In appropriate circumstances the claimant's testimony may be rebutted by the failure of the documentary evidence to mention what one would normally expect it to mention.10 Finally, the burden of proof remains with the claimant.11\nI find that the claimant's testimony is trustworthy and reliable. I believe that his situation is as he says it is. I have found in favour of his credibility for the following reasons. There were no improbabilities, implausibilities, or inconsistencies in his testimony. He did not exaggerate or embellish. He did not contradict anything he had already said or submitted in evidence. He did not evade my questions or omit significant information. His demeanour throughout the hearing was open, frank, and unhesitant.\nHowever, his claim involved serious exclusion issues and the panel has felt the need to subject the claimant and his testimony to more extended and rigorous credibility testing than would otherwise be the case in order to lay to rest concerns that arose related to his boss, arms merchant XXXXX XXXXXX, and XXXXXXX uncle, organized gangster XXXXXX.\nTo begin with, the claimant's story, when heard from beginning to end, made sense. He was a Jaffna Tamil who, if he were to enjoy a life of peace and some prosperity, was obliged to move away from Jaffna. Being good with numbers, he applied in XXXX 1980 to the XXXXXXX in Kandy for a job that involved XXXXXX. Eventually he was made XXXX and placed in control of XXXX for the XXXXXX and XXXX. However, the XXXXX had to close because of events connected with the ongoing war.\nWhen it reopened, the staff showed itself hostile to him as a Tamil. His job involved questioning them about XXXXX matters and the attitude of the other workers was that, after recent events, he was no longer welcome to do so as a Tamil. In XXXXX 1983, he decided he had better move on.\nHe replied to an ad in Colombo for a \"dealer.\" He thought it was a job in some form of trade. His employer, XXXXX XXXXXX, trained him to be a XXXXX and he accepted the new line of work. Very soon after, he was made a trainer and later moved up the management ladder to XXXXXXXX and XXXXX for the XXXXX.\nAs a Jaffna Tamil in Colombo, he said he had to be much more scrupulous than other employees just to hold down his job. He wanted to escape from being easily recognizable as a Tamil and adapted to his new life in Colombo by a number of strategies. He changed his first name to XXXXX. His last name was already suggestive of a XXXX background. He already knew English but he now set about learning flawless Sinhala, until it took a Sinhalese person ten minutes to recognize that he was a Tamil from his word usage. He trained his children in English first, and Tamil second, so that they could work with Sinhalese people but return to their Tamil roots when the war ended. He listed other things he had done - associating only with Sinhalese, remaining within the family circle, etc.\nHe explained that he was one Tamil among three in a total workforce of 350 XXXXXX employees. He stated that during his work at the XXXX there was no hostility from the staff even though he had authority as XXXXXX over XXXXXXXX. The staff knew he was a Jaffna Tamil but held no animosity against him. I find his story of the situation he faced and his responses to it to be plausible.\nDespite his best attempts to keep the war away from himself and his family, it suddenly intervened in his life with the visit to his house on XXXXX 2001 of two Tiger agents. It is important to realize that the portion of his story relating to the dangers he faced from the Tigers in Colombo was delivered at a very fast pace. His subjective fear was evident. Where he made errors in his recitation (such as once saying \"July\" instead of \"June\"), he was able to correct himself spontaneously and pick up his train of thought without contradicting himself or falling into inconsistencies. It was clear to me that these were lived-through experiences and not contrivance.\nMoreover, his reports of the conversation between him and the agents involved the use of slang which altered to reflect the rising urgency of the men who were threatening him. Given that he delivered his story at a clipping pace, the panel finds that he could not have been manufacturing or concocting the conversations he reported.\nIn their first visit, the two Tiger agents insisted on talking to him. The visit occurred some time after the Sunday Leader published an article in XXXXX 2001 on XXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXX involvement in arms dealing. (Neither the Board nor the claimant has a copy of this article, but I have no reason to doubt its existence.) The Tigers later showed up at his house a second time and insisted on being admitted into the house.\nThe agents pressed him to join with them. What they wanted was information on how XXXXXX was shipping arms, where they were coming from, where they would land, etc. They appealed to him as a brother. They reminded him of the death of their people at the hands of the SLA and their inhumane weapons, supplied by XXXXXX. They moved from entreaties to threats, threatening first to kill one child, then his wife, and next himself.\nWhen the LTTE made its initial overtures to him, he responded by thinking that he could convince them that he knew nothing of his boss, X XXXXXXX arms deals and, as a Jaffna Tamil, could not make enquiries without immediately drawing attention and suspicion to himself. He failed to dissuade them.\nHe next tried to fool them that he was in fact trying to make friends among other employees. He made one phone call in an effort to find someone who could give him the information the Tigers wanted. XXXXXXX personal secretary, XXXXX, told him only that XXXXXX had created a company to negotiate arms deals and had hired another personal secretary at three times XXXX salary. She was more concerned about the higher pay of her new colleague than anything else. The claimant felt that if he pressed XXXX for details she would immediately suspect him. That was as far as he pursued the matter. He testified that his one foray showed him how implausible it was for him, a Jaffna Tamil, to search for information, even to give the Tigers the illusion he was working for them.\nHe was able to stall the Tigers for months by telling them that it would take time to penetrate the XXXXXX organization. When this did not work he stopped answering the phone, but, realizing that he had now defied the Tigers, he moved out of his house, first to his mother-in-law's on XXXXX and later to his sister-in-law's on XXXX, before the family ultimately left the country for Canada.\nHis account of these events was told with sober and sincere demeanour. At no time did I feel the claimant was trying to deceive the panel. His emotion was consistent with his story. In my view, consistent emotion is not easily fabricated and warrants a conclusion of \"transparent\" demeanour. Counsel called it \"integrity.\"\nBecause of the serious issues connected to the claim, the panel and RPO tested the claimant's credibility in numerous ways. At one point, the panel stopped him in the middle of his story and asked him what security reason prevented XXXX employees from mixing socially. I wanted to see if he could stop, digress, and pick up the thread of his story without falling into credibility problems. He replied that any threat of XXXX misdealings would likely start because of a conspiracy cooked up by a number of employees. XXXXX owners knew that. There was therefore a general rule preventing XXXX employees from knowing each other personally. This prevented a conspiracy from forming. Having answered my question, he picked up his train of thought at the same fast pace as before and continued without falling into contradiction or inconsistency.\nAgain, at another point, I said that I might call their son, XXXXX, to testify at the hearing. They both agreed without undue hesitation. Their words, their actions, and their demeanour remained open and they were able to continue with the hearing without falling into credibility problems following the request.\nOn another occasion, I asked the claimant if he would permit me, right then, to call XXXXX, the XXXXXXXX, who had told them on XXXXXXXX that their house had been burned down. The claimant agreed to the request. At that time, I did not make the call.\nBut later, the panel felt the need for independent corroboration of the allegation that his house had been torched and asked him again if the Board could call XXXXXXX. He again agreed without hesitation.\nIt is necessary here to note that XXXXXXX had asked the claimant to call the XXXXX from time to time to ensure that no problems had arisen that required the claimant's input. Three days after he had arrived in Vancouver, the claimant called the XXXX. It was at this time that the XXXXX informed him of the police call.\nAfter discussing potential risks and deciding upon a procedure with the parties, the Board asked the claimant himself (aided by the Board's interpreter) to be the go-between, on the understanding that all was being recorded and that all would be translated. The panel did not want XXXXX to feel restrained in his answer by suddenly receiving a call from a strange Canadian board of inquiry.\nThe Board called the XXXXX. The panel asked XXXXXX, the XXXXXXX, the substance of the last phone call between him and the claimant. The XXXX said, without hesitation, that he had received a call from the police on XXXXX and they had told him that the claimant's house had been looted and burned down. The police considered it arson and were looking for him to tell him. The XXXX told the police that the claimant was not available. The police asked the XXXXX to have the claimant call them when he was. The XXXXX said the claimant, who was at the time still employed by the XXXX, called him on XXXXXX to ask how things were. At that time, the XXXXXXX told the claimant what the police had told him.\nThe RPO and the panel asked the XXXXX questions and received answers which were consistent with the claimant's own earlier responses. The panel finds that the XXXXX has corroborated important elements of the claimant's story.\nThe claimant furnished the panel with other indications of his credibility as well. One was his willingness to testify truthfully on matters that ran counter to his interests. In one instance, the claimant testified that, on the advice of his travel club, XXXX, he had created a bank account in which he circulated a sum of money to give an impression of solvency and modest prosperity. He said that the travel club had suggested circulating an amount of 800,000 rupees (or Cdn $12,500). He had submitted his bankbook to the Canadian government in aid of getting a Canadian visitor's visa. This is evidence of a successful attempt to deceive the immigration authorities of this country, but it is not enough, if other evidence were lacking, to defeat his claim.\nA second instance arose when the RPO told him that there had been extortion among XXXXX in Colombo.12 Was he aware of that? Yes. But he knew of no extortion at his. The panel suggested to him that it was no wonder, since his XXXXX were owned by XXXX XXXXXX, whose uncle was the underworld crime boss, XXXXX.13 He said he knew of no extortion because the XXXXX oversees the flow of money from the XXXX floor to the management. He will not know that extortion takes place. When it does, it involves the gangster taking the XXXXX owner to another place and threatening him. He was not aware that his boss had ever been threatened.\nWhat he said is borne out by the country reports.14 Even though the information could have been potentially damaging to him, he testified without hesitation and remained open. Nothing in his demeanour as he related these details gave me cause for concern.\nA third example occurred when the Minister's Representative asked him why his predecessors were replaced. He replied to the effect that there had been enough financial irregularities to justify their dismissal. He voluntarily detailed the charges against his predecessors, even though these details could have led to potentially embarrassing questions. He did not take sides with management or employees, a quality that was observable in his behaviour as he delivered his testimony. I found his lack of hesitation and even-handed testimony also to be credible.\nThe RPO asked him why the Tigers continued to want his cooperation after the second Sunday Leader article, which says that XXXX XXXXXX had not been arms-dealing for a year.15 He replied that the second article left open the possibility that XXXXXX might be involved in next year's planned arms expenditures because of the corruption of the current contract holders. But more to the point he said he had already been contacted and asked for cooperation before it was known that XXXXXX was not involved in that year's arms deal. The demand that he penetrate XXXXXXX organization had already been made of him and there was momentum to the Tigers' demand. I find the claimant's testimony on the subject to be plausible.\nThe claimant's story held up under questioning by the Minister's Representative, RPO, and panel. I find his testimony to be credible and the claimant to be a reliable and trustworthy witness in the matter of his own claim.\nI have endeavoured in my credibility analysis to show points at which the claimant's allegations are borne out by the objective evidence. I find that these examples and the evidence of the remainder of the documents in disclosure to show that this claim is objectively well-founded.16\nNexus\nI agree with counsel that the claimant's refusal (signified by unplugging his phone) to take more phone calls from the Tiger agents constitutes what would be perceived as an act of defiance and hence an expression of political opinion. From his testimony and that of XXXXX, the XXXXXXXX, I infer that the claimant's resistance to the Tigers' demands is further represented by his moving from his home and leaving Sri Lanka. The burning of the claimant's home and the Tigers' contacting his parents appear to indicate that the Tigers are interested in taking reprisals against him. I find the nexus of this claim to be perceived political opinion.\nChange in Circumstances\nThe country reports show that the Sri-Lankan government and the Tamil Tigers typically use the cessation of hostilities to re-arm.17 It is exactly this situation that drew the claimant to the Tigers' attention and presented the threat of persecution in his life. I find that the claimant faces more than a mere possibility of persecution as a result of the continuing struggle between the Sri-Lankan Government and the Tamil Tigers and that there has been no change in circumstances of which he is the beneficiary.\nDelay\nThe claimant received his first visit from the Tigers on XXXX 2001, but only left Sri Lanka XXXXX 2001. Questioned about this, the claimant said that he had been planning to take a vacation that year and had begun making preparations since January 2001. He had already decided on Canada as their vacation destination in XXXX of 2001 and had made bookings. His troubles with the LTTE began after these events, in XXXX of 2001.\nHe thought that time would remove his problem and tried to stall the Tigers. He left Sri Lanka when their threats became so aggressive that he felt his family and he were in danger. I have already discussed above the manner in which he stalled the Tigers. I have also discussed the details of his departure from Sri Lanka. I find his explanation to be plausible. It resolves the apparent issue of delay.\nState Protection\nThe claimant's reasons why he did not involve the police, the army, or his employer were plausible, given the circumstances of a Jaffna Tamil in Colombo. He said that he needed permanent protection from the Tigers, not protection for a day or a week. He gave the example of a police officer the Tigers killed. The policeman was allegedly the subject of a Tiger poster, which sentenced him to death. However, he was not killed until some years later, after his retirement. He also pointed out that the police have been unable to protect Sinhalese politicians. If they could not protect Sri Lanka's Sinhalese leaders, how could they protect him? Why would they do so? he asked.\nHe worried that the army would take control of his situation and use him as bait to catch the two Tigers. If they did, his whole family might be murdered.\nHe had similar objections to contacting his employer. Mr. XXXXXX might involve the police or the army and he would again be given temporary protection or used as bait. Or he could be dismissed from Mr. XXXXXXX employment and cease to be a man anyone protected. I agree with the claimant's assessment of the situation. The court in Ward18 has said a claimant should not be required to seek state protection at the potential cost of his life.\nInternal Flight Alternative\nThe claimant stated that the Tigers had already contacted his parents in Jaffna shortly after he left to find out where he was. If they could find him in Jaffna, and find him so quickly, he believed that they could find him anywhere in Sri Lanka. I am inclined to agree with him that, if he is wanted by the LTTE for having failed to cooperate with them, he is in danger wherever he resides in Sri Lanka.\nHe related the story of the Jaffna mayor and policeman. The country documents in disclosure show that the mayor has been killed.19 The example of the policeman, which I have discussed above, was adduced as evidence of the long temporal reach of the Tigers. Neither counsel nor I had evidence relating to the policeman. But much evidence in disclosure attests to the long reach of the Tigers.20\nI find there to be no IFA in Sri Lanka for the claimant or his family.\nArticle 1F(a)\nThe panel's security concerns in relation to the claimant's story were high from the outset. The claimant's XXXXX is an arms importer, working within a corrupt government matrix, in opposition to a dangerous rebel organization. The weapons XXXXXX imports are legal but highly questionable weapons of war - Schmel thermo-explosive rockets and launchers which are indiscriminately destructive to personnel.\nHowever, nothing in the claimant's testimony suggests that he himself has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity or is in any way involved in XXXXXXX armament business.\nHe did not pose as knowing nothing about that business. He knew as much as a person in his situation might be expected to know. He stated that he had first learned of XXXXX arms dealing, along with the rest of Sri Lanka, from the papers in February of 2001. On 12 August 2001, he learned from the Sunday Leader21 more about XXXXX arms deal, including the fact that XXXXXX was not used for the second shipment of 900 Schmel rockets and\nlaunchers. His account of what he knew and how he came to know it was delivered credibly and left no doubt in the panel's mind that, while the Tigers sought to exploit his proximity to XXXXXX, the claimant himself had no connection with arms trading. The panel finds that Article 1F(a) does not apply in this case.\nArticle 1F(b)\nIn addition to the panel's original concerns associated with the claimant's employer, XXXXXXXX, my concerns about XXXXXX uncle, XXXXXX, a ruthless gangster from Sri Lanka, were also high. Was the claimant a participant in serious crimes of a non-political nature, that would have him be excluded from Canada under Article 1F(b)?\nThe issue arises because of the presence in the background of his work life of crime boss XXXXXX and XXXXXXX relationship to the claimant's XXX, XXXX XXXXXX. XXXXXXXX is undoubtedly a major Sri Lankan crime boss, responsible for hideous murders, extortion, and a long list of other crimes. But the panel can see nothing in the claimant's testimony and nothing that it has received from the Minister that would lead it to believe that the claimant has committed or was complicit in a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission as a refugee. The panel finds that Article 1F(b) also does not apply in this case.\nCONCLUSION\nThe panel finds that the claimant has proven his credibility. It accepts that he faces more than a mere possibility of persecution in Sri Lanka from the Tamil Tigers as a result of his perceived political opinion. It finds that he cannot avail himself of state protection under the circumstances of his situation and that no safe IFA exists for him or his family in Sri Lanka. For all of these reasons, it finds the male claimant to be a Convention refugee.\nThe female claimant and the three minor claimants have made their claim entirely dependent on that of the male claimant. The panel finds them as well to be Convention refugees for the same reasons it has given in his case.\nDETERMINATION\nIn light of these findings, the panel determines that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, and XXXXXXXXXXX are Convention refugees as defined in IRPA, section 96 and accepts their claims for refugee protection.\n\"S.M.

He studied books and took pride in being a member of this special Church. He actively tried to recruit others, including co-workers. This practise led him to be fired from four successive jobs over the next three years. His relationships with his relatives also suffered, notably with his mother who forced him to move out of the family home in 1999.\nHe went to live in Pecs with his girlfriend and joined the Church of Scientology there. Police and business owners harassed him for distributing fliers in the street. After losing three jobs in Pecs his girlfriend gave up on him. He then started to receive abusive threatening telephone calls from individuals who did not identify themselves but whom he believes were his former co-workers.\nAt the time, the government, supported by the media, had become publicly hostile toward Scientology, claiming that the Church was taking peoples' money. The claimant talked to fellow members about what had happened to him; they were experiencing similar problems.\nAt the end of May or beginning of June 2000 he noticed a police car parked outside the house; this occurred about five more times before he left the country. Other Church members reported police surveillance too. The claimant states in the PIF he was close to a nervous breakdown and could not cope with the situation any more, so he started to plan his departure. He stopped his weekly handout of fliers and then went to a church meeting for the last time in July 2000.\nHe flew to Canada, via Germany, and arrived in Calgary August 27, 2000. From there he came to Vancouver where he made a refugee claim September 18, 2000.\nAbout a year later, he withdrew his refugee claim2 and returned to Hungary to see his mother who had been hospitalized with heart problems. He took care of her until her condition improved sufficiently and then came back to Canada, again via Germany, and made another refugee claim on December 1, 2001. According to his new PIF,3 during his stay in Hungary he rarely left his mother's house and did not make any contact with the Church of Scientology.\nHis oral evidence is that he has only been to the Church of Scientology once in Canada and that is because he does not yet speak English well enough.\nISSUES\nThe following issues were identified: personal identity, per the requirement under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA);4 credibility; agents of persecution; objective basis; state protection; Internal Flight Alternative (IFA); and subjective fear, related to the claimant's re-availment and failure to make a claim elsewhere (Germany).\nCounsel asserted at the hearing that although there is some public debate as to whether Scientology is a religion, that is the appropriate Convention ground for this claim, and that the claimant would not be relying on the consolidated grounds in Section 97 of the IRPA. Although the Minister gave notice of the intention to participate on March 12, 2002, 5 concerning the issue of credibility, a representative did not attend the hearing.\nANALYSIS\nPersonal Identity\nThe claimant has provided his Hungarian passport, the airline ticket voucher for his current trip to Canada, a copy of his Hungarian driver's license, study progress reports from his vocational training in construction and related final examination results.6 The Refugee Protection Division is satisfied as to his personal identity.\nCredibility\nGenerally the claimant was a credible witness as to his belief in Scientology and his perception of the beneficial effect it has had on his life, notwithstanding the alleged harassment and discrimination he endured and the fact that the Church's tests had shown that he should make numerous self-improvements.\nHis knowledge and understanding of the teachings of the Church, while quite rudimentary, appear to be at a level not inappropriate to his particular educational background; and he was forthright about the gaps in his knowledge. He was able to correctly identify the name and publication date of doctrinal book by founder Ron L. Hubbard cited in the documentary evidence7 and, in the course of outlining the testing procedure, made reference to the \"e-meter\" called this in the documentary evidence and said to be an electropsychometer.8 He demonstrated that he knew the meaning of the \"dia\" part of the term \"dianetics,\" which is the name of the religious doctrine, but admitted he does not know what the rest of the word means. He claims to have read all of the books connected to Scientology, but allows he has not understood everything.\nThe Refugee Protection Division accepts that the claimant was a practitioner of Scientology in Hungary.\nThere is a question as to whether the claimant lost four jobs because of his religious beliefs and proselytizing activity or for some other reasons, not covered by the 1951 UN Convention. His vocational school records indicate that his work habits were less than satisfactory and possibly this carried over into his employment. None of the human rights reports in evidence make any reference to members of the Church of Scientology having been wrongfully dismissed as a result of religious prejudice in Hungary, although they do mention the concern in Hungarian society about the influence that some new churches have over their followers.9\nAlso of apparent significance is the fact that in May 2000 - around the time the claimant was feeling the most pressure according to his PIF - there was a \"heated debate\" going on in Hungary over Scientology. A new book had been released that was heralded as an expos\u00e9 of the dangers of this religion and of the number and influential position of its followers in the country. It presented documented Hungarian case studies. The author is quoted in a news article as stating that the book was for the public, not the police, although the authorities could draw their own conclusions.10 That same year, the Hungarian Taxation Authority government launched an investigation into the Church's registration of clergy.11\nThus it is reasonable to assume that these two events would have brought the Church of Scientology into some degree of controversy or disrepute in 2000 and perhaps made companies intolerant of a new employee who was actively trying to recruit members from among his co-workers.\nHowever, there are a couple of matters that do raise serious doubts about the credibility of the claimant's allegations and the fundamental reason why he ultimately left the country. One is the absence of any testimonial letter or indeed any record of his membership in the Church of Scientology in Hungary, either in Mohacs or Pecs. The claimant's older brother has been of assistance in sending other kinds of documents but the claimant himself did not obtain such proof even though he went home to Hungary for three months before returning to Canada to make a second refugee claim based on religious persecution. According to the PIF, throughout that period he did not contact anyone from the church. His oral testimony is more troubling: that he did not want the Church of Scientology to know he was back in Hungary.\nThe claimant did not provide a satisfactory explanation for this questionable behaviour or for his failure to provide documents from the Church of Scientology to corroborate his involvement in Hungary. His wish to remain inside the family home so as not to expose himself to more mistreatment is not relevant to this point since it is reasonable to expect that he could have made telephone contact or received visitors.\nWhen questioned closely about that, the claimant's answers were not clear or straightforward. He seemed to suggest that the Church was silent when he left Hungary and he interprets this to mean they do not look on him favourably, and that after having made a refugee claim he would not look any better. He also suggested vaguely that it would not be good for them to get involved in a negative thing like this, apparently referring to his refugee claim. Yet the claimant maintains that the Church of Scientology did not know he \"escaped\" or that he has made a refugee claim based on his mistreatment as a member. He mentioned that he does not know what happened after he left and that his pride would not allow him to contact them. But he was emphatic that he does not want them to know where he is because \"there may be some consequences.\" He clarified that if he were to contact the Church of Scientology some other people would come after him.\nStill, the claimant denied that he has done something to upset the Church of Scientology in Hungary and he said he did not know what the Presiding Member was talking about in making reference to the information in evidence on fraudulent activities of the Church.12\nThe second, related matter of concern is the claimant's explanation for the fact that he has only once gone to the Church of Scientology in Canada and has not distributed leaflets at all. He says that his English is not good enough. But this is at odds with other statements, to the effect that his sole aim in learning English was to practise Scientology and that his English has really improved in the last year and now he can communicate with his co-workers.\nThe Refugee Protection Division is left with the possibility that the claimant may be avoiding contact with the Church of Scientology because he has done something to offend or discredit it in Hungary. Given the timing of his initial departure, it is possible that he figured in the book that was published in XXXX 2000.\nIn sum, on the issue of credibility, the Refugee Protection Division finds that the claimant has provided sufficient credible evidence to establish that he practised Scientology in Hungary, but not that this was the reason he was fired from four jobs and ultimately left the country.\nObjective Basis\/ State Protection\nThe issue of the objective basis and its subset, state protection, is the determinative issue in this claim. There is no credible evidence that the followers of the Church of Scientology are subject to serious harm in Hungary, although there is a degree of state discrimination against the institution itself. Moreover, the claimant has failed to provide \"clear and convincing evidence\" of the state's inability to protect him.\nAccording to the objective country information, the constitution of Hungary provides for freedom of religion and generally respects this right in practice. The government at all levels strives to protect this right in full and does not tolerate its abuse, either by governmental or private actors.13\nGenerally, the larger or longer established religions receive more favourable tax treatment than the minority religious communities like the Church of Scientology in that donations are tax deductible for only 14 of the 136 registered churches in the country. However, this is not a factor in the instant refugee claim. In September 2001 - while the claimant was actually back in Hungary - the Hungarian Tax Authority closed its investigation of the registration of the clergy in the Church of Scientology and found no evidence of wrongdoing.14\nThe United Nations' fourth periodic report on Hungary's implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights notes that the country's Labour Code prohibits discrimination between employees on the grounds of religion or \"any other circumstance not related to their employment.\"15 The observance of the rules prohibiting discrimination are monitored by inspectors and infringement falls under the category of misdemeanours and is liable to a fine of up to 30,000 HUF.16\nThe claimant's evidence is that he did not seek state protection for his dismissals from employment or the telephone threats he received from former co-workers or for the verbal abuse he received from business owners and the police (in Pecs) for handing out flyers. He testified that he did not seek state protection for his religious and labour rights because he perceived the police to be part of the problem - due to their treatment of him on the street over the flyers and the police car parked outside his home.\nThe Refugee Protection Division finds that the claimant could well have been under police surveillance in 2000 because of the tax investigation underway at that time. However, the Refugee Protection Division prefers the objective information that affirms Hungary's adherence to the constitutional right of freedom of religion. In view of that evidence, the Refugee Protection Division finds that even by the time the claimant returned to Hungary in 2001, his claim for refugee protection was not objectively well founded. Because he did not approach the state during that visit to report his earlier mistreatment, but returned to Canada instead and asked for surrogate international protection, the Refugee Protection Division finds he has failed to provide clear and convincing evidence of Hungary's inability to protect him as a national.17\nDETERMINATION\nFor all the reasons above, the Refugee Protection Division finds that the claimant has failed to provide sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish his claim to refugee protection under the grounds in Sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA. Moreover, his claim is not objectively well-founded and he has failed to provide clear and convincing evidence of the state of Hungary's inability to protect him. Accordingly, the Refugee Protection Division determines that XXXXXXXXXX is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection in Canada.\n\"Barbara Hodgins\"\nBarbara Hodgins\nDecember 18, 2003\nDate\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - RELIGION - CREDIBILITY - EVIDENCE - DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE - DOCUMENTATION - OBJECTIVE BASIS - STATE PROTECTION - MALE - NEGATIVE - HUNGARY\n1 Exhibit 6.\n2 Exhibit 4.\n3 Exhibit 1.\n4 Section 106 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n5 Exhibit 7.\n6 Exhibits 3 and 8.\n7 Exhibit 5, page 47.\n8 Ibid, page 49.\n9 Exhibit 5, pages 29-34.

The Minister's application alleged the Respondents obtained these determinations by fraudulent means and\/or misrepresentation, suppression and\/or concealment of material facts. On May 15, 2001, the IRB had granted the Minister leave pursuant to section 69.2(2) of the Immigration Act (then in effect) to make the application.\nThe Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \"Act\") replaced the Immigration Act effective June 28, 2002. As the hearing of the Minister's application had not commenced as of that date, pursuant to the transition provisions in section 190 of the Act, the application was continued and considered under section 109(1) of the Act. That section states:\nThe Refugee Protection Division may ... vacate a decision to allow a claim for refugee protection, if it finds that the decision was obtained as a result of directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding material facts relating to a relevant matter.\nIn their Personal Information Forms (PIFs)1 signed on May 21, 1997, the Respondents indicated they were citizens of Afghanistan and had no other citizenship. They said they left Afghanistan on XXXXXXX, 1996 and traveled through Pakistan, Thailand and the USA before arriving in Canada on February 4, 1997. They said they were persecuted as Hindus in Afghanistan.\nMINISTER'S ALLEGATIONS\nThe Minister alleges the Respondents had been living in India, not Afghanistan, before they came to Canada; the Respondents misrepresented the date when they left Afghanistan; the Respondents misrepresented their travel route to Canada; the Respondents misrepresented their knowledge about their citizenship and the whereabouts of certain relatives; the Respondents misrepresented their names, citizenship and dates of birth; and the Respondents misrepresented their reasons for travelling to the USA.\nRESPONDENTS' POSITION AND ADMISSIONS\nThe Respondents deny most of the Minister's allegations. They say they were persecuted in Afghanistan as Hindus, but make the following admissions of misrepresentations or omissions in their Personal Information Forms:\n1. The Respondents now say they left Afghanistan in 1993 - not 1996 as set out in their PIFs. They say they lived in India from 1993 to 1996 without status, until they travelled to Canada. Their PIFs say they lived in Afghanistan until 1996 and make no reference to any residence in India.\n2. Mrs. XXXX now says she was born in Afghanistan but moved with her family to India when she was a child. She was educated in India and had Indian citizenship. She returned to Afghanistan in 1969 after she married Mr. XXXX. This is contrary to the information in her PIF which says she lived in Afghanistan from 1951 to 1996 and was educated in Afghanistan. She admits this information is incorrect.\n3. The Respondents now say they travelled to Canada on false Indian passports with Canadian visitor visas with the surname of XXXXXX. They say they lost these passports in Canada and, prior to making a refugee claim, they applied for and received replacement Indian passports in the name of XXXXXX. None of this information was provided in their PIFs.\n4. Mrs. XXXX now admits they travelled to the USA and attended the wedding of her sister in USA before coming to Canada. She did not provide that information in her PIF, nor disclose the presence of her sister in the USA.\n5. The Respondents now admit they flew from Boston to Toronto where they entered Canada. In their PIFs they said they entered Canada at the Douglas Border crossing in British Columbia.\n6. Mrs. XXXX now admits that in 1996 she knew her sister XXXXX was in the USA and her brother XXXXX was in India, and that both of these siblings were born in India and were not citizens of Afghanistan. In her PIF she says these two siblings are citizens of Afghanistan and their whereabouts are unknown. Mr. XXXX repeated this information in his PIF narrative.\n7. Mrs. XXXX now admits that when they arrived in Canada she knew her sister, XXXX, and brother-in-law were living in Canada. In her PIF she made no reference to the existence of her sister, XXXXX, nor the fact she lived in Canada.\n8. Mrs. XXXX now admits her family was not in Afghanistan in 1985. In her PIF narrative she alleges incidents that happened to her family in Afghanistan in 1985, including an allegation that a group of Mujahedin shot her brother dead in front of her father. She admits this is not true.\n9. Mrs. XXXX now admits she was not in Afghanistan in 1994 when the Taliban entered Kandahar. In her PIF narrative she said she stayed inside during that time to avoid the harsh way of life imposed by the Taliban in Afghanistan.\nANALYSIS\nFindings regarding additional misrepresentations\nI find the Respondents misrepresented other information in their PIFs. They do not admit to these additional misrepresentations but, based on the evidence, I find on a balance of probabilities the Respondents misrepresented the following:\n1. I find, on a balance of probabilities, the Respondents left Afghanistan before 1993, which they now claim. In support of their refugee claims in 1997, they produced an ID booklet from Afghanistan for each of them. The Respondents say these ID booklets were issued in 1993, and prove they were in Afghanistan at that time. However, these ID booklets do not have a date of issue, but give the Respondents' ages as of 1985. I find it very unlikely, and hence not plausible, that ID booklets issued in 1993 would provide the person's age as of 1985. I find it more likely these ID booklets were issued in 1985, and do not establish the Respondents were in Afghanistan in 1993.\nThe Respondents produced six witnesses at the hearing, all originally from Afghanistan, to support their claim that they were from Afghanistan. However, none of these witnesses gave evidence that the claimants were in Afghanistan after 1985. The first witness said he last saw the Respondents in Afghanistan in 1984-85. The second witness came to Canada in 1984, so did not see the Respondents in Afghanistan after that time. The third witness left Afghanistan in 1985, the fourth witness left Afghanistan in 1982, and the fifth witness left Afghanistan in 1984, and thus none of these witnesses had seen the Respondents in Afghanistan after those dates. The sixth witness came to Canada in 2000 but said he last saw the Respondents in Afghanistan in 1984.\nThe Respondents also submitted a document from Mr. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, a former XXXXX XXXXXX in Afghanistan, to certify that both claimants are nationals of Afghanistan. However, I find this is not a reliable document. It was submitted twice -- apparently signed both times by Mr. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and dated XXXXXX, 2002 on both copies. However, the stamp beside the signature indicates one document was signed in New Delhi, and the other was signed in Afghanistan. Obviously Mr. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX could not be in both places at the same time. I put no weight on this document, as there is no plausible explanation offered as to how Mr. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX was in both New Delhi and Afghanistan on the same day and why he signed the same document twice. Further, this document only says the Respondents are Afghan nationals, but offers no evidence as to when they were last in Afghanistan.\nThe Respondents also submitted an affidavit of XXXXX XXXX, who says he left Afghanistan in 1987. While he says he knew and saw the male Respondent in Afghanistan, he does not say when he last saw him in Afghanistan.\nFinally, I find the Respondents generally are not credible witnesses about when they left Afghanistan. They have misrepresented many facts in the past, and their testimony was vague about how often they allegedly travelled between Afghanistan and India, and how they crossed the border each time. I find they were vague and evasive, which reflects negatively on their credibility.\nTherefore, I find none of the supporting witnesses indicates they saw the Respondents in Afghanistan after 1985, the ID booklets were issued in 1985 not 1993, and the Respondents are not credible about their past residence. Based on this, I find there is insufficient credible evidence to show, on a balance of probabilities, the Respondents were in Afghanistan after 1985. I find the Respondents misrepresented this information on their PIFs. This has the effect of negating large parts of their PIFs, as follows:\n* on Mr. XXXXX PIF, questions 18, 22, 23, 29 and much of his narrative including parts of paragraphs 2, and 7, and paragraphs 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 23; and\n* on Mrs. XXXXX PIF, questions 18, 22, 23, 29, and her narrative paragraphs 5, 6, 7 and the references to her husband's narrative.\n2. Further, I find, on a balance of probabilities, the claimants have used two different surnames. In Afghanistan they used the surname XXXX, but in India they used the surname XXXXXX. They travelled to Canada on Indian passports in the name of XXXXXX. They say they were false passports. Yet when they lost these passports, they applied in Toronto to get replacement passports in the surname XXXXXX. They were able to obtain those replacement passports. I do not find it credible that the Respondents would apply for and be issued replacement passports if the passports were false and were in a false name. Further, Mrs. XXXXX brother-in-law in Canada advised the police that the XXXXX real surname is XXXXXX and they were from India. Mr. XXXX said this brother-in-law helped them get the replacement passports in Toronto, but he never told his brother-in-law the surnames on the false passports. I can find no plausible explanation for how the brother-in-law would know the surname XXXXXX, unless that was the surname used by the XXXXX in India.\nTherefore, I find the XXXX used the name XXXXXX in India and did not disclose that information on their PIFs. Thus, I find this was a misrepresentation on question 2 in their PIFs.\n3. Further, and following on the above finding, I find the XXXXX obtained valid Indian passports and CVVs, with the surname they used in India - XXXXXX. I find they did not travel on false passports or false CVVs. Again, this is confirmed by the fact they sought replacement of these passports when they lost them in Canada and were able to obtain those replacements.\nBased on this finding, I find the Respondents misrepresented information in questions 25, 27, 28 and 29 of their PIFs.\n4. Further, I find there is a lack of credible evidence that Mrs. XXXX lost her Indian citizenship. She says she assumed she lost it when she returned to Afghanistan in 1969 and took out citizenship there. However, she has nothing to confirm that assumption. She now admits she lived in India from 1993 to 1996. I have further found there is insufficient credible evidence to show, on a balance of probabilities, the Respondents lived in Afghanistan after 1985. Thus, they could have lived in India from 1986 to 1996. Both Respondents were able to obtain Indian passports. This indicates that may have had some legal status in India. Therefore, I find there is insufficient credible and reliable evidence to show Mrs. XXXX is no longer a citizen of India. Thus I find she made a misrepresentation on question 12 of her PIF. While I make no finding in this regard, I suspect Mr. XXXX had some form of legal status in India during the time he lived there before coming to Canada, under the surname of XXXXXX.\nFinding regarding section 109(1) of the Act\nI find the above misrepresentations and withholding of material facts, both those admitted by the Respondents and those I find to be additional misrepresentations and factual omissions, were material and significant to the determinations that the Respondents are Convention refugees. Further, I find these misrepresentations and omissions were made knowingly and deliberately by both Respondents. Therefore, I find the determinations made December 18, 1997 that the Respondents are Convention refugees were obtained as a result of the Respondents directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding material facts relating to relevant matters in their refugee determinations, as per section 109(1) of the Act.\nFinding regarding section 109(2) of the Act\nSection 109(2) of the Act authorizes the Board to reject the Minister's application \"if it is satisfied that other sufficient evidence was considered at the time of the first determination to justify refugee protection\". The case law establishes that, in making this assessment, I can have regard only to evidence that was before the Board when it originally determined these two claims, except for evidence that has been determined to be tainted by misrepresentations or withholding of facts.\nI find there is very little evidence that remains from the material considered in 1997 by the Board. The misrepresentations and withholding of material facts are so significant here that a determination could not have been made without a further inquiry into the Respondents' place of residence from 1985 to 1996 and the events that occurred to them during that time. The crucial information remaining for the male Respondent is that he was a Hindu in Afghanistan until the end of 1985. The crucial evidence remaining for the female Respondent is that she was a Hindu living in Afghanistan from 1969 until about 1985. There is no longer any evidence about where they lived after 1985 until they made their refugee claims in Canada in 1997. There is no longer any information about what happened to them and their families in Afghanistan after 1985. Large parts of their PIFs no longer remain, as determined above. Based on that large gap in their history, and the many gaps in their PIFs, I find there is insufficient evidence on which the Board could have granted refugee protection to the Respondents.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the above reasons, pursuant to Section 109(3) of the Act, the Minister's application is allowed and the claims of both Respondents are deemed to be rejected and the determinations made December 18, 1997 that the Respondents XXXXXX XXXX and XXXXX XXXX are Convention refugees are nullified.\nThomas H.

She says she has a well-founded fear of persecution based on membership in a particular social group. Specifically she fears violence and possible death from her former boyfriend.\nPostponement request\nAt the hearing on January 16, 2003 the claimant's counsel requested a postponement of the hearing. I denied that request. The hearing was originally scheduled for November 21, 2002. On that day her counsel appeared for the hearing and said she had just received a voicemail from a friend of the claimant which said the claimant was in hospital and unable to attend the hearing. Counsel requested a postponement of that hearing. Counsel had no proof of the claimant's illness, so I set the matter for a show cause and advised counsel the claimant needed to provide evidence of a medical reason for her failure to appear for the hearing. Subsequently, the claimant, through counsel, provided a medical note that said she was treated for \"Syncope - hyperventilation\" on November 21, 2002. While this is a relatively minor medical condition, I accepted it as an adequate reason for the claimant's failure to appear on November 21, 2002.\nOn December 19, 2002, the IRB received written notification from the claimant advising she had changed her counsel. At the hearing on January 16, 2003, her new counsel requested a postponement as he said he had been unable to prepare properly for the hearing. He said he had been retained only recently and did not receive the file until January 10, 2003. He said he had difficulty meeting with the claimant. Their first scheduled meeting did not occur as counsel was delayed for the meeting and the claimant left due to anxiety problems. At their second meeting, the day before the hearing, the claimant broke down and cried for the whole time and counsel was unable to obtain instructions. The claimant said the last time she saw a doctor was XXXXXX, 2002.\nI considered all the factors in Rule 48 and decided to deny the request for a postponement. The claimant's new counsel is a very experienced counsel in refugee matters. The claimant's anxiety problems had already caused a last-minute postponement of one hearing, and were being used as an excuse to postpone another hearing. There was no reason to think the claimant would be any more able to proceed on a future date. Her file had been carefully prepared by her former counsel, who had submitted personal documentation with translations. Her new counsel had been unable to prepare for the hearing with the claimant on two scheduled meetings, but I am satisfied this was entirely a consequence of the claimant's inability or unwillingness to control her anxiety. Again, there was no reason to think her ability or willingness to control her anxiety would improve if the hearing was postponed. The claim is not a particularly complex claim, as it is based on potential abuse from a former boyfriend. I decided there were no exceptional circumstances for postponing the hearing. I also decided that allowing the application would unreasonably delay the proceedings. Considering those factors and the other factors listed in Rule 48, I denied the request for a postponement. I gave a short adjournment for counsel to talk to his client. I note that in the course of the hearing the claimant remained calm and collected at all times, except when she became a bit weepy at one point when talking about her grandmother with whom the claimant had lived until her grandmother died. From the claimant's conduct at the hearing, it was clear she was able to control her anxiety when necessary. At the end of the hearing, I was satisfied that the denial of the postponement request had not compromised the claimant's case.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant's mother, father and three sisters and brother all live in California. They are all US citizens, except possibly her mother who is in the process of becoming a US citizen. The claimant's father has applied to sponsor her immigration to the USA, but the US authorities have not made a decision on that matter.\nThe claimant lived with her grandmother in the family house in Mexico until 1993 when her grandmother passed away. After that the claimant lived on her own. In 1998 she met a man called XXXXXXX. In 2000 they became boyfriend and girlfriend. Mr. XXXX became increasingly possessive of the claimant, and said she should not consider leaving him because he was capable of killing her. Her relationship with Mr. XXXX got worse. He was violent and jealous, and assaulted two of her male friends who he saw talking to her. He spied on the claimant. She tried to break off the relationship. On two occasions, Mr. XXXX tried to break into her house after dark. On both occasions she screamed and he left without gaining access to her house. She reported the first incident to the police who said they could not intervene if nothing happened. Mr. XXXX continued to spy on her. She felt trapped and fearful. She then decided to leave Mexico. She came to Canada as a visitor in XXXXX 2001 and made a refugee claim on November 7, 2001.\nDETERMINATION\nI find the claimant is not a Convention refugee and is not a person in need of protection.\nANALYSIS\nCredibility\nI find the claimant is not a credible person. First, I note that for some reason the claimant failed to inform Canada Immigration that she had a current, valid Mexican passport. When she made her refugee claim she provided a cancelled Mexican passport. On all the forms she filled out, including her Personal Information Form, she indicated that was the only passport she had in her possession. However, by the time she made her refugee claim, she had renewed her Mexican passport. She said she did not produce it at that time, as she was never asked for it. However, she failed to note anywhere in her documentation that she was in possession of a valid passport. She only produced this information on questioning at the hearing. I find the claimant failed to disclose the existence of this passport earlier and clearly provided incomplete and inaccurate information on her Personal Information Form, which is a document she signed and declared to be true and correct to the best of her knowledge. Further, apparently she did not advise her counsel that she had another passport, as counsel did not submit a copy of it. I do not know why the claimant deliberately hid the existence of her valid passport but, based on this behaviour, I make a negative finding about her credibility.\nSecond, the claimant says she travelled from Mexico to Canada with a male friend whom she had known about a year. She has lived with this man in Vancouver since their arrival in April 2001. She says she does not know why he came to Canada. She says he has made a refugee claim, but she has never discussed his claim so she does not know the basis of his claim or what he fears in Mexico. She said it is just a coincidence that the two of them came together, live together in Vancouver and both made refugee claims. I do not believe the claimant. She had known this man for a year before she left Mexico and has now lived with him for over one and-a-half years in Canada, and yet claims to know nothing about why he made a refugee claim and is unwilling to return to Mexico. It is not credible that two people who have known one another and been living together for such a long time have not discussed this important part of their lives. I do not believe it is a mere coincidence that the claimant came with this person and they both made refugee claims. I do not know the truth of their story, but I do not believe the claimant's story. Again, I find the claimant is, generally, not a credible person.\nThe claimant says in Mexico she had few friends, had no job, did not go to school, did not travel, and was not involved in activities. Again, I find the claimant is not credible. She is not forthcoming. She did not disclose the existence of her valid passport, she will not disclose what she knows of her roommate, and she will not disclose any details of her life in Mexico. She has a very limited story about her alleged ex-boyfriend, but is unable or unwilling to provide any other details of her life. In those circumstances, I find there is insufficient credible evidence to accept her claim.\nInternal Flight Alternative\nI find the claimant has an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) in Mexico. She lived in a small town and had problems with Mr. XXXX. She lived on money provided by her mother and father from the USA. When she asked for money to come to Canada, her mother sent the money. The claimant said that if she had asked, her mother would have sent her money to move to a larger city in Mexico, such as Guadalajara. She said she did not consider moving to a larger city in Mexico because she felt Mr. XXXX would find her wherever she moved. However, she could provide no reason for thinking he could find her anywhere in Mexico. She says she just thinks it. However, given her lack of credibility on other matters, I doubt the truth of that statement. Further, even if she does believe it, that does not make it true. I find there was no credible evidence provided that would suggest there was more than a mere possibility Mr. XXXX would have followed her and found her if she had moved to a larger city in Mexico. Further, given that she was supported by her mother and she said her mother would have provided her with money to move to Guadalajara, I find it would not be unreasonable, in all the circumstances, for the claimant to move to Guadalajara to avoid Mr. XXXX.\nState Protection\nI find the claimant has not rebutted the presumption of state protection nor shown that it was reasonable for her to not seek state protection. The claimant went to the police only one time. Mr. XXXX tried to break into her house, but ran off when she screamed. The police said nothing happened, so they took no action. The claimant did not tell the police that Mr. XXXX tried to break in again. The claimant did not tell the police that Mr. XXXX threatened to kill her.\nThe country documentation indicates Mexico has a functioning police and judicial system.1 There are problems of corruption with the police, however the country documentation does not suggest that police protection is generally not available. The police did not abuse or threaten the claimant when she went to them. They merely said nothing happened. Based on the country documentation and claimant's evidence, I fine there is not clear and convincing evidence that the state was unable or unwilling to protect her. Further, I find it was not reasonable for the claimant to fail to go to the police after the second attempted break-in. There is nothing to indicate the police would have harmed her in any way. And, as there had been a second attempted break-in and threats, there was additional information on which the police could have acted if the claimant had sought their protection. She provided no reason for not going to the police again, other than to say they did nothing the first time. In all the circumstances, I find it was not reasonable for the claimant to not return to the police and seek protection.\nCONCLUSION\nBased on the evidence, submissions and above analysis, I find the claimant is not credible that I doubt that much of her story ever happened. Further, I find she had an accessible and reasonably available Internal Flight Alternative. Finally, I find she has not rebutted the presumption of state protection. Therefore, I find there is less than a serious possibility the claimant will be persecuted on any of the Convention grounds, including gender as part of a particular social group, or will face a risk to her life, a risk of cruel and unusual punishment or treatment, or a danger of torture if she returns to Mexico.\nTherefore, the Refugee Protection Division determines XXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX is not a Convention refugee and is not a person in need of protection.\n\"Thomas H.

The claimant arrived in Vancouver on 13 August 2000 and made a claim to be a Convention refugee on . The hearing into the claim was held pursuant to section 170 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA),1 at Vancouver, B.C. on 5 May 2003.\nIn determining whether the claimant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, I have considered all the evidence, including the claimant's Personal Information Form (PIF),2 oral testimony, the documentary evidence filed by counsel and the Refugee Protection Officer (RPO), counsel's submissions, IRPA, and the relevant caselaw.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant's PIF alleges that natives invaded his home immediately after the May 2000 coup, tied the family up, beat his brother, and stole their cash, appliances, and food. The police did not respond to their pleas for help.\nThe natives attacked their property again, removing their crops and livestock. The police again did not respond.\nThe family had planned to take a trip to Canada to visit his sister. His brother advised him that the situation was not improving. XXXXX, the brother, did not abandon the property because the family owned the land. As a result, the claimant's sister decided to sponsor the family to Canada. But when the final sponsorship decision was received, the claimant was not included. The claimant then made a refugee application.\nISSUES\nThe issues in the claim were credibility, delay, objective basis, change in circumstances, compelling reasons, state protection, and discrimination vs. persecution. The determinative issues were credibility, objective basis, and change in circumstances.\nANALYSIS\nCredibility\nIn general the claimant answered questions in a straight-forward manner. I believe he has exaggerated his peril in saying, for instance, that he will be killed if he returns to Fiji. Nothing in the literature, as I will illustrate below, suggests that the threat of violence against Indo-Fijians in Fiji at the present time reaches remotely near that level. Again, the claimant's PIF emphasizes events that happened around the time of the coup and in the ensuing months. Only in the hearing room did the claimant acknowledge that nothing of any consequence has happened to his brother or his brother's family since they sold the family land.\nDelay in Claiming\nThe claimant landed in Vancouver on 13 August 2000 and made his refugee claim on 14 January 2002. However, he explained this delay satisfactorily. His sister applied to sponsor his family, but the interval between the application and the decision was so long that the claimant, by then, had been 18 months out of school and was ineligible any longer to be sponsored. As soon as he heard CIC's decision, he immediately made a refugee application. His account of events is borne out by the documents in disclosure.3 I accept his explanation.\nObjective Basis, Change in Circumstances, and Discrimination vs. Persecution\nA change in country conditions is relevant if it helps the panel to determine whether or not there is, at the date of the claimant's hearing, a reasonable and objectively foreseeable possibility that the claimant will be persecuted in the event of his return there.4 Factors such as durability, effectiveness, and substantiality are relevant.5\nI shall analyze change in circumstances here only as they relate to the circumstances of this particular claimant, who is a 23-year-old former student of computer hardware electronics, likely to live in an urban setting. Were he, for instance, an elderly Indo-Fijian widow living in a rural setting, my analysis below would be different in important respects. Since the claimant has expressed no interest in farming and is suited by education and practicum experience to the installation and repair of computer hardware, I will not analyze here the situation of rural Indo-Fijian farmers in Fiji.\nThe serious, persecutory human-rights abuses that armed native thugs committed during and following the May 2000 disturbances appear to have ceased in Fiji. These included assaults and terrorizing of rural Indo-Fijian families, the rape of Indo-Fijian women, the looting and burning of Indo-Fijian rural and suburban homes sometimes with loss of life, the destruction of urban businesses and schools, and urban\/rural temples, all without significant state protection. Four documents are central to a consideration of change in circumstances in Fiji: the U.S. State Department Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2001 and 2002, the Australian Country Information Service report from December 2002, and the Research Directorate, IRB, issue paper, Fiji: Situation of Indo-Fijians since the Coup of May 2000, issued in April 2002.\nDOS Report 2001\nReleased 4 March 2002, the DOS Report for 2001 states that \"the harassment of Indo-Fijians and the destruction of their property during 2000 did not continue during the year.\" It observed that \"the country's political situation remains unsettled\" and \"ethnicity remains a dominant factor in the country and affects the country's politics, economy and society.\"6 The Government's \"human rights record remained poor, although it improved somewhat\" after the August-September 2000 elections.7 \"Ethnically based discrimination remains a serious problem.\"8 It listed Fiji's problems in general, some of which apply to the society at large rather than just Indo-Fijians.\nA Number Of Government Policies, Including Hiring Practices, Education Policies, And Land Tenure Preferences Continue To Provide Protection For Indigenous Fijian Interests In Accordance With The Constitution. Other Human Rights Problems Include Several Political Or Arbitrary Deprivations Of Life; Occasional Police And Military Abuse Of Detainees And Suspects; Informal And Formal Constraints On The Freedom Of Speech And The Press And Self-Censorship; Restrictions Of Freedom Of Assembly And Movement; Violence And Discrimination Against Women; Instances Of Abuse Of Children; And Racial Discrimination And Violence.9\nThe DOS Report states that \"the media operates without prior censorship, but with considerable self-censorship.\"10\nGovernment ownership of shares in the Fiji Post newspaper and its links to the Fiji Sun newspaper through Fijian Holdings, an investment company on whose board a number of ministers have served, call into question the complete independence of the press. Newspapers occasionally print editorials critical of the Government and occasionally conduct investigative reporting. Criticism, albeit muted, of the once-sacrosanct traditional chiefly system is appearing more frequently. However, the Government still views negative comments about individual chiefs with disfavor. The Government also owns the Fiji Broadcasting Corporation with four radio stations.11\nThe report indicates that the Human Rights Commission was able to investigate Indo-Fijian complaints and receive police cooperation.\nThe HRC resumed operations in mid-September 2000 with a school-based human rights poster contest and resumed distributing publications. It conducted interviews in the Muaniveni area and collected personal interviews from Indo-Fijians in the area. Copies were sent to the police, who investigated the events. During the year, it appeared to be impartial and independent.12\nAccording to the DOS Report, the native agenda behind the coup seemed to have been achieved by the time it was issued (March 2002) and its achievement is said to have led to an easing of tensions and a return to normalcy, albeit under the new native-dominated dispensation, which the report describes thus:\nTension between ethnic Fijians and Indo-Fijians has been a longstanding problem. The stated purpose of two military coups in 1987 was to ensure the political supremacy of indigenous Fijians and to protect their traditional way of life and communal control of land. ... George Speight, the leader of the takeover of Parliament in May 2000, professed to have taken action on behalf of ethnic Fijians in attempting to overthrow a government led by the country's first Indo-Fijian Prime Minister (see Section 3). Following the elections in August, some observers noted that there is a potential for the institutionalization of unequal political rights based on ethnicity.13\nIRB Issue Paper\nIn April 2002, the Research Directorate of the IRB published an issue paper, Fiji: Situation of Indo-Fijians since the Coup of May 2000.\nOf relevance to this claim, it found that many businesses had not been repaired because insurance policies did not cover civil disturbances. As of August 2001, aside from a few small capital loans, businesses had received no compensation from the state.\nIn terms of state protection, many of those charged with offences committed at the time of the coup had been released by the judiciary.\n[Jone] Dakuvula [of the Citizen's Constitutional Forum] ... claimed that key figures still present in influential positions in the police, army and judiciary had supported Speight's actions and that: \"All branches of the state have been affected by the ethnicised agenda of Speight and the [Interim] administration cannot be regarded as neutral towards Indo-Fijians. In fact it mainly espouses indigenous Fijian supremacist ideas\" (ibid.).14\nThe issue paper recounts many instances of police participation or complicity in crimes at the time of the coup, for which perpetrators have not been punished. As a result of their experience during and following the coup, the Indo-Fijian community has the perception that the police will not act on their complaints. According to SFU Professor Michael Howard:\nThe police present a serious problem. What progress had been made in reforming the police towards the end of the 1990s seems to have come to an abrupt end. The close association between the head of the police and the [Speight] group has not helped and is indicative of a lack of any serious will within the upper ranks of the police to deal effectively with the situation.15\nProfessor Pratendra Prasad of the University of the South Pacific (USP) claimed that \"state institutions do not offer adequate\/equal protection to Indo-Fijians\" and alleged that members of both the police and military were involved in violence.16\nWhile the DOS Report 2001 stated that \"the harassment of Indo-Fijians and the destruction of their property during 2000 did not continue during 2001,\" some observers on the ground in Fiji cast events in a different light. In the summer of 2001, both Fiji Labour Party (FLP) Leader Mahendra Chaudhry and human-rights activist Sashi Kiran claimed that attacks on, and robberies of, Indo-Fijians continued to occur, including attacks on Hindu temples.17 Dr. Howard said that the gangs responsible for earlier attacks were still active in the western and eastern parts of Viti Levu in June of 2001.18 In January 2002, USP Professor Prasad reported the murders of an Indo-Fijian taxi-driver and a domestic worker and the torching of a Hindu temple. He held that attacks against Hindus and Muslims were actually increasing.19 I note that the DOS Report did not say that no attacks occurred, but that the pattern that had prevailed previously did not continue. The increase that Professor Prasad points to may also be accounted for by the increase in robberies, which extended to the entire population, and not simply to Indo-Fijians, as we shall see in the CIS Report, below.\nOn the other hand, other observers agreed with the conclusions of the DOS Report and saw a decrease in overall tension and violence. Jone Dakuvula of the Citizens Constitutional Forum stated that he was not aware of many reports of attacks on Indo-Fijians during the year 2001. Dr. James Chin of the University of Papua New Guinea, a specialist in Pacific Island politics, also stated that he had not heard of Indo-Fijians being forced from their homes other than those who had to leave at the end of their leases. An increasing number of urban robberies at supermarkets and jewellery stores had created a climate of fear among urban Indo-Fijians.20\nSome observers, like Kiran, agreed with the finding of the DOS Report 2001 that the media engaged in self-censorship and asserted that many pertinent incidents were not reported. She also claimed that there has been some exaggeration as to the extent of attacks. Others like Dr. Howard argued that in May 2001 the lack of reports of attacks on Indo-Fijians was due to the lack of investigation by international media as well as the local media's concentration on political events instead of what is happening in the countryside.\nCIS Report\nIn December of 2002, the Country Information Service, Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs of the Australian Government, published a background report on the situation in Fiji. In it, the Australian researchers state that \"the potential for further violence remained high.\"21 By \"violence\" it meant both criminal and racial violence. Indo-Fijians living in rural areas where there is a low police presence and continuing post-coup ethnic tensions are subject to \"incidents of low-level theft and violence.\"22 Indo-Fijians living in the cities:\n... are often targets of burglary due to a general expectation that they are more likely to keep their jewellery and cash on their home premises. Press reporting indicates, disturbingly, that \"home invasion\" style robberies, often violent, are also increasingly. Increasingly, however, the more affluent indigenous Fijians living on urban areas are also being targeted - a new trend.23\nIt reported certain events that probably worked to bring down tensions overall. These included the public apology by President Iloilo to those living at the Gurmit Centre relocation camp and his offer of financial assistance of up to $5,000 to help farmers opting to return to their homes. A second event was the assurance given by indigenous families in the Muaniweni and Naitasiri settlements that Indo-Fijian families would be allowed to return and live in safety.\nIndigenous Fijian families [in the area] have ... given their assurances for the safetely [sic] of Indo Fijians returning to their homes. Apart from a few isolated incidents of verbal threats and one incident of common assault, the returning Indo Fijian residents have not been subjected to the incidents that occurred during the height of the crisis.24\nIn regard to state protection, the CIS points out that:\nAn Indo-Fijian citizen who has a complaint against a police officer can take the matter up with the Department of Internal Affairs in the Fiji Police Force which will investigate the complaint. The matter can also be taken up with the Fiji Human Rights Commission or the Ombudsman's Office if the complainant feels that the Internal Affairs Department's investigations are not sufficient. None of these services require payment by the complainant.25\nWhile acknowledging the Fijian Government's \"Blueprint,\" which favours native Fijians and Rotumans, the CIS report found that \"there are no formal barriers to the access of Indo Fijians to employment, education and services.\"26 The picture that is therefore painted by the CIS is of a country returning to normal, except for an increase in criminal activity such as urban robbery.\nDOS Report 2002\nAccording to the DOS Report 2002, released on 31 March 2003, \"ethnicity remained a dominant factor in the country's politics, economy, and society\" and \"ethnic discrimination remained a serious problem.\" Following free and fair elections in 2001, [Fiji's] political situation improved.27 There were occasional reports of human-rights abuses by the police, primarily the beating and extortion of three Indo-Fijian citizens who reported a theft.28 Some Government ministers made racist slurs which went unpunished.\nOn several occasions Members of Parliament (M.P.s) made racist remarks against Indo-Fijians. 29\nIn July human rights groups strongly criticized Minister of Women, Culture and Social Welfare Asenaca Caucau for comparing Indo-Fijians to \"wild grass taking up space\" in the country. Despite pressure, Caucau refused to apologize, and the Prime Minister failed to discipline Caucau for the remark. Senators appointed by the Prime Minister have made numerous racial slurs directed against Indo-Fijians.30\nThe judiciary appeared to remain susceptible to political interference. Police corruption, including the hiring of some decommissioned military personnel as special constables who had criminal records for robberies and other illegal activities, remained a problem. A small Hindu temple suffered minor vandalism and Muslim workers for the Revenue and Customs Authority were asked to shave off their beards because they were judged to be not neat or professional in appearance.31\nThere were no complaints of government pressure on or interference with the media. Domestic and international human-rights NGOs generally operated without interference, investigating and publishing their findings on human-rights cases, with government officials responding in a generally-cooperative manner.32 The Gurmit Centre refugee camp was closed after all residents returned home or resettled in the Lautoka area.33\nDuring the year, the Human Rights Commission \"appeared to be impartial and independent.\" Approximately one-fourth of the valid complaints it dealt with were on racial or ethnic-equality issues.\nThe HRC has received approximately 700 requests for assistance since it began operation in 1999. Most involved alleged abuse by police and prison officers. Although it had a backlog, the commission investigated most of the claims, as well as allegations against the military involved in the November 2000 mutiny. The HRC's work was hampered by the Constitutional Redress Rules, which stipulated that the HRC and others had to file human rights cases in the High Court within 30 days of receiving the complaint. The HRC continued to host a weekly radio program to educate citizens about their rights under the 1997 Constitution.34\nThe report is notable for the lack of allegations of native actions against Indo-Fijians. The lower level of anti-Indo-Fijian activity suggests that the indigenous population of Fiji has largely abandoned its persecution of the Indo-Fijian minority for the present time. Given that the natives have been successful in ensuring their predominance in government, I see no reason why violence should break out again. I find that the situation for Indo-Fijians similarly-situated to the claimant has returned to normal and that this change in circumstances is durable, effective, and substantial.\nClaimant's Situation\nThe claimant alleged that the family's house was subject to theft and stoning until the house and land were sold in XXXXX 2002. After that his brother and sister-in-law moved in with his wife's extended family. The claimant stated that his brother did not say past that point that he had any continuing problems with the natives. The fact that the brother had no continuing problems with the natives strengthens my finding that circumstances have returned to normal for Indo-Fijians similarly situated to the claimant and his siblings.\nThe DOS Report 2001 states that \"skilled workers and professionals have departed the country in large numbers.\"35 The flight of skilled workers and professionals, in my opinion, could as likely raise the value of the claimant's computer-hardware installation and repair skills as restrict their value.\nThe CIS report suggests that \"displaced\/evicted farmers have gained jobs including as garment factor[y] workers or security officers. Many have had difficulty finding employment in urban areas because of their lack of training, education and skills.\"36 The claimant has training, education and skills that displaced farmers do not have. He has completed two-and-a-half years of a three-year electronics program. His latest practicum involved repairing computer motherboards, troubleshooting, setting up computer networks, and laying network cable. He alleges that he will not be able to find employment because he has not finished his education. However, in my opinion, the skills that he has at present are marketable in Fiji. I do not believe that the normal business that employs hardware repair and installation professionals would require a college graduation certificate if he is able to do the work involved. If the claimant needed to return to school to finish his last semester, he thought his family would probably support him to do so.\nThe claimant said that employment comes from who you know. I do not accept that a young man who has attended a technological institute with an instructor and fellow students has not thereby created contacts in his chosen field.\nThe claimant argues that he will have difficulty finding employment in Fiji as well because he has no work history. However, the claimant does have work experience. He has worked at XXXXXXX since XXXXX of 2002 and at XXXX XXXXX XXXX in Suva on a college practicum.\nThe claimant said he would be targeted as an Indo-Fijian living on his own. When it was pointed out that attacks on Indo-Fijians as Indo-Fijians (rather than as targets of criminal opportunity, along with native Fijians), have subsided, the claimant said that he believed the targeting of Indo-Fijians was still occurring in rural areas. I do not believe that events occurring in the countryside pose a threat to the claimant, whose education and work skills orient him towards an urban setting.\nThe claimant states that he will not be able to survive in Fiji because he has never lived on his own before. However, he is twenty-three and has worked in the past. He is not a minor. I see no bar to him living on his own.\nThe claimant considers that he will be targeted for robbery because he is an Indo-Fijian. However, the CIS report indicates that both indigenous Fijians as well as Indo-Fijians are targeted. What the claimant fears is common crime, perpetrated against all Fijians. I find the driving force behind it to be profit rather than racial antipathy. His fear of crime does not bring his claim under the auspices of the U.N. Convention.\nThe claimant stated that the natives went for cash because they do not work. He believed however that the natives only went for Indo-Fijians and would not harm their own\npeople. I prefer the evidence of the Country Information Service that all Fijians are open to being robbed. That evidence comes from Australian foreign-service personnel stationed in Fiji, who have no interest in this refugee claim in particular or refugee matters in general.\nThe panel has found that a durable, effective, and substantial change in country conditions has occurred in Fiji since the coup of May 2000. In the face of it, the panel determines that, at the present time, there is no reasonable or objectively foreseeable possibility that the claimant will be persecuted in the event of his return there. At most the treatment that he may face amounts to discrimination, but not persecution. I find that this change in circumstances removes the claimant from Convention-refugee protection.\nCompelling Reasons\nCounsel has not argued that any compelling reasons warrant not sending the claimant back to Fiji and I see none. While the claimant's treatment at the hands of the natives immediately after the coup was unfortunate, it did not reach the level of atrocious, appalling, severe, or grave and offers no impediment, as far as I can see, to his return.\nConsolidated Grounds\nI find that the crime that has increased in urban Fiji is generalized in nature and is faced by the population as a whole rather than by Indo-Fijians only. As such it does not bring the claimant's claim within the definition of a person in need of protection contained in IRPA section 97(1)(b).\nApart from the consideration of crime, no other argument based on the two other protection grounds has been advanced. I determine that there is no credible evidence that would allow me to conclude that the claimant is a person in need of protection.\nDETERMINATION\nIn light of these findings, I determine that XXXXXXXXXX is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, as defined in IRPA, sections 96 and 97 and I therefore reject this claim for refugee protection.\n\"S.M.

He claims to have a well-founded fear of persecution from the state by reason of his ethnicity as an Eritrean Ethiopian.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe following is a synopsis of the claimant's story taken from his Personal Information Form (PIF)1 and supplemented by the evidence at the hearing.\nThe claimant was born in XXXXXXXXXX, Ethiopia in 1983. The claimant's mother and father were Ethiopian citizens of Eritrean descent. He has never lived in Eritrea. His mother left him when he was about four or five years of age. He never saw or heard from her again. The claimant was a 15-year-old boy when his father disappeared in 1998. He and his brother had been at home when state authorities took his father away. About three weeks later a letter arrived advising the two boys that they had been supporting the Eritreans in the war and telling them to turn themselves into the police. Rather than do so both fled to Kenya. They lived in hiding in Kenya for several years. Eventually, the claimant's older brother had him smuggled out of the country to Canada. The claimant arrived at Vancouver International Airport on January 16, 2002. He claimed for refugee protection at the airport.\nIn the Port of Entry notes the claimant was asked whom he was claiming against. He stated that he was claiming against both Ethiopia and Eritrea. In his PIF he claimed only against Ethiopia.\nDETERMINATION\nI find that the claimant is a Convention refugee, as he has a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in Ethiopia. In arriving at this determination the panel has considered all the evidence submitted, his testimony at the hearing, observations made by the Refugee Protection Officer (RPO) and counsel's submissions. My reasons follow.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\nA number of issues were identified at the hearing. Firstly, there is the issue of identification. The claimant produced only a Baptismal Certificate.2 He said that a contact in Winnipeg had arranged to have it sent from his church in Ethiopia. It is a printed document. On the left the handwriting is in Amharic. However, on the right he has handwritten in the equivalent English - in order to assist his counsel he stated. As well, he provided the picture to his contact who provided it to the church. There are no security features to this document and it has obviously been altered. However, the panel found the claimant to be a credible witness. He readily volunteered the fact that he had \"translated\" the right hand portion of the certificate. Because he was credible and because he conducted the hearing in the Amharic language and wrote in that language at his CIC interview I accept that he is Ethiopian.\nNationality\nAnother central issue in this claim is the citizenship of the claimant. Does he have both Ethiopian and Eritrean citizenship? In his CIC interview he stated that he is claiming against both countries; against Eritrea because he believes they would force him to join the army and fight Ethiopians. Also, his brother had told him that he could not go to Eritrea because of his father - indicating that it would be dangerous. The claimant does not know what the particular reason is and what his father might have been involved in.\nAt issue is whether the claimant has citizenship in Eritrea because his parents were born in Eritrea. The documentary evidence in this regard is far from satisfactory.\nThe Eritrean constitution of 1996 states in Article 3 (1) Any person born of an Eritrean father or mother is an Eritrean by birth and (2) Any foreign citizen may acquire Eritrean citizenship pursuant to law (UNPAN 2000).\nCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices for 20013 states the following regarding citizenship for Ethiopians of Eritrean descent in reference to deportees from Ethiopia during the 1998-2000 war:\nThose who no longer had connections in Eritrea were placed temporarily in camps with IDP's [internally displaced persons] before being settled among the general population. To facilitate the deportees' integration into society, the Government provided them with documentation that was valid for 6 months and identified them as deportees. If, during that time, the deportees could find three Eritrean witnesses willing to testify to their Eritrean ties, the Government issued them documentation of Eritrean nationality and considered them to be permanent citizens. For the small minority of deportees who could not demonstrate Eritrean ties, the Government granted them identity documents that specified that they were Ethiopian but permitted them to stay in the country (Country Reports 2001, 4 Mar. 2002).\nA senior researcher in the Africa division of Human Rights Watch (HRW) stated in a telephone interview that although the Eritrean government has welcomed Ethiopian citizens of Eritrean origin into the country and has provided them with humanitarian and resettlement assistance along with refugee identification papers, they have stopped short of giving them citizenship (24 Sept. 2002). The HRW researcher said that the Eritrean authorities consider these people to be Ethiopian citizens (ibid.).\nIn the UK Assessment on Ethiopia it also notes that a \"... person born in Eritrea or with an Eritrean parent is eligible for citizenship.\"4\nIt is important to note that it is not clear whether the claimant would have automatic citizenship or whether he would require the testimony of three Eritrean citizens as to his ties with the country. In this regard it becomes important to keep in mind that the claimant's mother left him when he was but a few years old and he has never heard from her since. Equally, his father was taken away when he was 15 years of age and he has never seen him since either. He appears to have no ties with Eritrea and he stated that he does not speak the language.\nAt issue is whether the claimant has to successfully make a claim against both Eritrea and Ethiopia. As I understand the case law, in order for a claimant to have the right to citizenship in Eritrea it must be virtually automatic. In other words the completion of a few formalities should be enough to result in his obtaining citizenship.5 In my view this is not the case here. It is by no means certain that even if he wanted to - which he clearly does not - the claimant could secure the favourable testimony of three Eritrean witnesses. Consequently, the panel finds that the claimant does not have Eritrean citizenship or the automatic right to it even though both his parents were born there when Eritrea was part of Ethiopia.\nThat being said the issue then becomes whether on the balance of probabilities if the claimant were to return to Ethiopia there is more than a mere possibility that he would be persecuted because of his Eritrean ethnicity\/nationality.\nThe claimant testified that the authorities took his father away in 1998. He testified about the letter requiring he and his brother to report to the police station as they were suspected of assisting the Eritreans in 1998. The documentary evidence adds support to these statements. The situation during this time was dire and violent. Amnesty International noted:\n... that the deportation of people with Ethiopian passports, or who were born or who spent their entire working life in Ethiopia, has now developed into a systematic, country-wide operation to arrest and deport anyone of full or part Eritrean descent. Fifty-two thousand Eritreans have been arbitrarily deported from Ethiopia over the last seven months, 6,300 so far in January 1999...People of all ages, from babies to pensioners, are imprisoned in harsh conditions for several days before being forced to board buses under armed guard with only one piece of luggage each ... Families have been split up, the male head is usually deported first, and his wife, parents and children weeks or months later. The many Ethiopians married to Eritreans are forbidden to leave and forced to watch helplessly while their spouse and children are deported.\nDeportees have had to abandon their homes, possessions, businesses and other property with no guarantee of ever recovering them. Individuals who have protested have been threatened or beaten. The deportees were arbitrarily stripped of their Ethiopian citizenship without any warning, legal process or right of appeal (ibid.).6 [emphasis added]\nThe two-year war cost tens of thousands their lives and it is estimated that over one million people were forced from their homes.7\nA cease-fire agreement between the two states was signed on June 18, 2000. Eventually a peace accord was signed in Algiers on December 12, 2000. Nevertheless, Ethiopia continued to expel Eritrean nationals or Ethiopians of Eritrean descent well after that period.8\nFollowing the peace accord, concern has been expressed internationally about the treatment in Ethiopia of Eritrean Ethiopians.\nIn a report dated 5 September 2001 the United Nations Secretary-General expressed concerns about the treatment of Eritreans in Ethiopia in particular it was noted that those interviewed had reported long-term detention without due process, often in poor conditions. There were also allegations of ill treatment, discrimination in access to social services and harassment by civilians and officials. The Secretary-General called on Ethiopia and Eritrea to reconsider their positions with regard to the treatment of each other's nationals. He further urged them to comply strictly with international human rights and humanitarian law standards and their commitments under the peace agreement.9\nThe DOS Report for 2001 indicates that there have been reports that some Ethiopians of Eritrean origin have note been allowed to vote or register.10 There have been reports that some are not even allowed back into the country.\nThe United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), citing an interview with the Information Officer at the Eritrean Embassy in Washington, D.C., regarding whether Ethiopians of Eritrean origin who were expelled have returned to Ethiopia, noted that the Officer \"was not aware of anyone having returned\" (30 May 2001). A senior researcher at Human Rights Watch (HRW) explained during a telephone interview that in practice, Ethiopians of Eritrean descent are not allowed to return to Ethiopia and that he had heard reports of people being denied entry into the country (24 Sept. 2002).11\nSome are yet detained.\nSome civilian residents of Eritrean origin have been detained since the outbreak of hostilities between Ethiopia and Eritrea. The Government justified these detentions on grounds of security. Approximately 200 civilian residents of Eritrean origin remained detained in the internment camps at Dedesa at year's end (see Sections 1.c. and 2.d.).12\nPutting together the various strands of the puzzle what emerges is a young man who fled Ethiopia when he was 15. His mother deserted him when he four or five years old. The Ethiopian authorities took his father and he has never seen or heard from him since. He has lost contact with his only sibling. He has been told that his father had problems in Eritrea. The evidence supports the story told by the claimant. There were deportations, detentions, killings and disappearances. Some Ethiopians of Eritrea descent cannot even gain entry to their country. All of this lends credence to the plight of these people. The claimant was credible. In the panel's view there is more than a mere possibility that this claimant would be persecuted should he return to Ethiopia. As the state is the agent of persecution, neither protection nor an internal flight alternative are available.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, I conclude that XXXXXXXXXXX is a Convention refugee.\n\"Michael A.

She has had problems with her weight since she was a small child. She suffered criticism from her parents, particularly her mother, because of her weight problem. She had further problems because of her weight with some of her classmates as she continued through school. She felt rejected in school and in her social life through her adolescence and later in university. She attributed her problems to her obesity and the attitudes of society in general in Venezuela towards obese people, particularly women.\nThe claimant graduated from university as a systems engineer in XXXXX 2001. she then briefly sought suitable employment before she decided to come to Canada to learn English, which she believed would assist her in future employment opportunities in Venezuela. She made her claim for refugee protection some eight months after she arrived in Canada.\nDETERMINATION\nThe panel determines that the claimant is not a Convention refugee and she is not a person in need of protection.\nANALYSIS\nThe panel has considered all of the evidence: the Personal Information Form (PIF)1 and oral testimony of the claimant, the materials filed by her counsel, the materials filed by the Refugee Protection Officer (including the materials from Canada Immigration) along with her counsel's oral submissions. In assessing this claim, the panel has also considered the Chairperson's Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender Related Persecution.2\nThe claimant provided a lengthy PIF narrative in which she detailed many of the incidents, which led her decision to not return to Venezuela. She appeared to relate many of her past problems in life solely to her weight. At the hearing, she did not appear to fit the dictionary definition of obese as \"very fat, corpulent\".3 This was surprising because, according to her PIF narrative, she had gained weight since she had been in Canada. No evidence was presented as to what her weight actually was, if she was medically overweight, or how her weight compared to others, male or female, in Venezuela.\nThe claimant stopped living with her family in 1992 and moved to the city of Merida. There, she attended the University of the XXXXXXX, Universidad XXXXXXX She studied engineering for approximately nine years and graduated as a systems engineer in XXXX 2001. She provided no evidence that she was impeded in her academic studies because of her weight or that she was denied admission to any academic institution on that basis.\nIt would appear that she made minimal efforts to seek employment after her university graduation and before she left Venezuela and came to Canada to study English. She did testify that she sent out a number of resumes and job applications. From those efforts, she did receive two job interviews, one with a government institution and another with a private company. However, she was not offered either position. It appeared that there were other persons who also had applied for these jobs and others who had also been interviewed. For one position, she had no information about who the successful applicant was, nor did she know how many other people had also been interviewed for it or their qualifications. As far as the other position, she only knew that the successful applicant was another female graduate of the same university whose marks were not as good as hers. She speculated that the reason that particular woman was offered that job was because she was either pretty or was not overweight.\nAccording to the claimant, there were a limited number of available job openings for engineers at that time in Venezuela, so she decided to learn English. She believed that obtaining knowledge of English would assist her to obtain employment, as it would be a valuable qualification to offer employers in Venezuela. While she was looking for work in the brief period after she graduated, she also applied to come to Canada. As soon as she was granted the visa to come here to study English, she stopped looking for employment. At the time she left Venezuela for Canada, it was her intention to return there to pursue her career in engineering.\nAs a result of her experiences in the months after her arrival in Canada, she found the atmosphere here to be more accepting of persons with weight concerns. It was almost eight months after her arrival here that she initiated her refugee claim. This lengthy delay before she sought protection, which was not satisfactorily explained by her, was indicative of her lack of subjective fear of persecution in Venezuela.\nThe claimant appeared to be a sincere individual. However, much of her evidence appeared to be based on speculation on her part. It appeared that while she did have inter-personal problems over her weight with her family, particularly with her mother, and also, to a lesser extent, with her father, it was also clear that her family had supported her financially and other ways during the nine years that she attended university. They did so because, as she explained,\" that is the way it is done in Venezuela\".\nFrom the documentary materials4 on Venezuela, there is nothing mentioned about concerns over discrimination against persons who are obese or even overweight. The 2001 U.S. Department of State Country Reports on Human Rights Practices5 does not mention problems with obesity as one of the concerns faced by Venezuelans generally or even one of those concerns specifically faced by women. It would appear that there is a desire on the part of some people in Venezuela, both women and men, to improve their appearance. A recent news article6 indicates that cosmetic surgery is a growing industry there, but only for those who can afford it.\nThe question is whether the claimant suffered treatment that could be considered, even cumulatively, as persecution. She has basically had little or no employment history in Venezuela, having only worked as a babysitter for a period of time while she was attending university. In effect, she was just starting out in her professional career as a self-supporting adult and as a graduate engineer. It was her decision to terminate her search for employment early on in order for her to come to Canada to gain English skills and enhance her qualifications for future work in Venezuela.\nPersecution has been defined as serious mistreatment (suffered or anticipated) inflicted with repetition or persistence, or in a systematic way. As the Supreme Court of Canada set out in Ward:\nThe dominant view, however, is that refugee law ought to concern itself with actions which deny human dignity in any key way and that the sustained or systemic denial of core human rights is the appropriate standard. This theme sets the boundaries for many of the elements of the definition of Convention \"refugee\". \"Persecution\", for example, undefined in the Convention, has been ascribed the meaning of \"sustained or systemic violation of basic human rights demonstrative of a failure of state protection\".7\nThe requirement that the harm be serious had led to a distinction between persecution on the one hand, and discrimination or harassment on the other, with persecution being characterized by the greater seriousness of the mistreatment which it involves.8\nThe Court also said in Ward that:\n... the international community did not intend to offer a haven for all suffering individuals. The need for \"persecution\" in order to warrant international protection, for example, results in the exclusion of such pleas as those of economic migrants, i.e. individuals in search of better living conditions, and those of victims of natural disasters, even when the home state is unable to provide assistance. 9\nThe United Nations High Commissioners for Refugees Handbook On Procedures And Criteria For Determining Refugee Status10 states on the question of discrimination:\n54. Differences in the treatment of various groups do, indeed, exist to a greater or lesser extent in many societies. Persons who receive less favourable treatment as a result of such differences are not necessarily victims of persecution. It is only in certain circumstances that discrimination will amount to persecution. This would be so if measures of discrimination lead to consequences of a substantially prejudicial nature for the person concerned, e.g. serious restrictions on his right to earn his livelihood, his right to practice his religion, or his access to normally available educational facilities.\n55. Where measures of discrimination are, in themselves, not of a serious character, they may nevertheless give rise to a reasonable fear of persecution if they produce, in the mind of the person concerned, a feeling of apprehension and insecurity as regards his future existence. Whether or not such measures of discrimination in themselves amount to persecution must be determined in the light of all the circumstances. A claim to fear of persecution will of course be stronger where a person has been the victim of a number of discriminatory measures of this type and where there is thus a cumulative element involved.\nThe claimant may have perceived that she has suffered discrimination from her family and from other persons, which has affected her personal life in Venezuela because of her weight. However, it was not clear if her life was that affected. It did not prevent her from having friends and having had a three-year romantic relationship with a man, after she moved away from her parents' home to attend university.\nIt is also noted that the claimant received an advanced education in a society in which, according to the documentary evidence, at least seventy (70) percent of the population lives in poverty. She grew up in a household that was much better off economically than most of her fellow citizens. Her father is a professional XXXXXX and her mother is a retired teacher. There was no evidence that her physical appearance prevented her from attending quality educational institutions and from studying the courses of her choice, as witnessed by her decision to switch from XXXXX engineering to systems engineering while she was at university. There was no credible evidence she was ever denied any right to an education.\nAlthough she said she sent out a number of resumes after graduating, it was not clear how many she actually did send. However, she was chosen for two job interviews, although she was ultimately unsuccessful in being hired for either job. She speculated that for only one of those jobs, she was not given preference (because of her weight) over the successful candidate. It was not clear what other attributes the successful candidates might have had which led those employers to choose them over the claimant.\nAlthough the claimant had alleged that it is required to submit a photograph with a job application to most employers in Venezuela, no evidence was presented that law mandated this. In any event, in at least two instances in the very brief time that she looked for work, she was still granted two interviews after submitting her photograph. At a time of high unemployment (17% in 2002)11 and with undoubtedly a number of potentially well-qualified applicants for any professional job vacancy, it is not unreasonable to conclude that her appearance was not a significant negative factor for potential employers when she could be offered two personal interviews shortly after her graduation and without any related work experience.\nIt was obvious that the claimant perceived the situation in Venezuela for herself in a jaundiced way. For example, she did mention in her PIF (paragraph 46 of her narrative) that:\nIn Venezuela, there are so many public places where the criteria to be allowed to enter is that a woman must be pretty, thin and white. If a woman does not have these prerequisites she simply would not be allowed in the place.\nAsked about that statement, the claimant appeared to be referring not to public facilities but instead to certain pubs or discotheques. Although she had not personally experienced such treatment, the source of her information appeared to be hearsay that she had heard from other young people. She was not referring to public places to which the public has access but to specific private businesses that required admission to be paid before entrance was granted.\nThe evidence is not sufficient to find that the claimant experienced a number of instances of discrimination that cumulatively amounted to persecution. There was no evidence that the claimant would be completely incapable of obtaining suitable employment in Venezuela solely because of her weight. According to the documentary materials, women in Venezuela now account for roughly half of the student bodies of most universities and they have advanced in many professions, including medicine and law. Women have gradually surmounted many of the former barriers to their full participation in political and economic life.12\nFrom the claimant's own evidence, she decided to stop looking for work and come to Canada to study English, which she believed would be an asset in her future search for work in Venezuela. There is evidence insufficient that she would not be able to obtain suitable employment in Venezuela if she made a reasonable effort to do so. While it is possible that the work she may initially obtain may not be exactly what she studied for, this is not an unusual situation for many job seekers who are willing to take a lesser job initially in the hope it will later lead to a more satisfying career in the field for which they have trained or wish to work. The evidence is insufficient that this claimant would not be able to find such employment if she returned to Venezuela.\nAlthough the claimant alleged that it was because she was an obese woman that she had problems with her weight in Venezuela, it would appear that her complaints related more to her perception of a general societal attitude towards both obese men and women.\nThe panel has also considered the Chairperson's Guidelines in respect to the claimant's subjective fear of persecution if she returns to Venezuela as a member of a particular social group (overweight or obese women). As to whether her allegations fall within the Guidelines, the panel noted the following:\n1. GENERAL PROPOSITION:\n3. Women who fear persecution resulting from certain circumstances of severe discrimination on grounds of gender or acts of violence either by public authorities or at the hands of private citizens from whose actions the state is unwilling or unable to adequately protect the concerned person. In the refugee law context, such discrimination may amount to persecution if it leads to consequences of a substantially prejudicial nature for the claimant and if it is imposed on account of any one, or a combination, of the statutory grounds for persecution. The acts of violence which a woman may fear include violence inflicted in situations of domestic violence and situations of civil war.\nThe claimant has not been the past victim of any form of violence, whether in a domestic setting or in general in society. There is no evidence that the state, even indirectly, has had any part in the discrimination that she claims to have suffered. That discrimination cannot, even cumulatively, be considered to have amounted to persecution. There was also insufficient evidence presented to conclude that her alleged mistreatment was gender based and that male citizens of Venezuela (who were also obese) would not face similar instances of discrimination.\nAccordingly, there is insufficient credible or trustworthy evidence presented to find any \"serious possibility\"13 of persecution for any Convention reason if the claimant should return to Venezuela.\nThe panel has also considered whether the claimant is a person in need of protection, under section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.14 There is also a lack of sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to find that the claimant has any \"serious possibility\" that she would be subjected personally to a danger of torture or to a risk to her life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Venezuela.\nCONCLUSION\nAfter a consideration of all of the evidence, the claimant is determined to not be a Convention refugee. She is also not a person in need of protection.\nTherefore, the panel rejects the claim of XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX for refugee protection.\n\"I.W. Clague\"\nI.W.

The hearing into the claim was held pursuant to section 170 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA),1 at Vancouver, B.C. on 29 July 2003.\nIn determining whether the claimants are Convention refugees or persons in need of protection, I have considered all the evidence, including the claimants' Personal Information Forms (PIF),2 oral testimony, the documentary evidence filed by counsel and the Refugee Protection Officer (RPO), counsel's submissions, IRPA, and the relevant caselaw.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe female claimant made her claim dependent on the male claimant's story. The male claimant's PIF alleges that his father was a full Roma and his mother an ethnic Hungarian. His father died when he was eight. He was raised with Roma playmates in a Roma neighbourhood and with Roma schoolmates. He suffered discrimination as a child and student.\nHe could not find jobs after graduation because of his Roma accent. He was fired from one long-time job as a product manager in a donut factory because he was Roma and the firm changed hands. In 1998, he was severely beaten by the police simply because he was Roma. In September of 1998, he met his wife, whom he married in 2001. She experienced discrimination from her doctors who wanted to know why she wished to bring a Gypsy baby into the world.\nIn 2001, they spent five months in the U.S. and returned to Hungary. In XXXXX 2002, he was fired from a department store when a customer spit on him and complained that the store hired Roma. For all these reasons he came to Canada.\nISSUES\nThe determinative issue in the claim was credibility. Failure to claim elsewhere, re-availment, and ethnic identity were also issues and are analysed here as elements of credibility.\nANALYSIS\nCredibility\nThe male claimant does not present himself as an obviously Roma man. He acknowledges that he does not physically resemble a Gypsy or dress like one. He testified that he denies he is a Gypsy when the question is raised.\nHe claimed to live in a Roma neighbourhood where he developed Roma mannerisms and a Roma accent. In his PIF he claimed to mix only with Roma students for his entire school career. Though this was the case, the claimant did not know how to say \"hello\" or \"goodbye\" or to count from one to three in any Roma language.\nThe claimant said that white Hungarians could tell he was a Gypsy by the way he walked. When asked for details, he was unable to give any. He was asked if he saw other Roma walking that way and he said he did, but he was still unable to describe it.\nI informed the male claimant that counsel and I were giving him opportunities to demonstrate his Roma ethnicity and expressed the hope that he would take up the opportunity but his answers throughout the hearing were unhelpful and often had a tinge of defiance. An example of his unhelpfulness was his reply to the question, what did he discuss with his Roma schoolmates. He said that they discussed what all children discussed - their likings, their dreams, etc. I asked him again for discussions on Roma topics and he replied a Roma child would talk about the same subjects as a Hungarian. As a result of numerous exchanges similar to this, I find the claimant to be uncooperative and to be misleading the panel.\nI asked the claimant to name the three Roma linguistic groups and he replied Olah, Beash, and Hungarian Gypsy. \"Olah\" is not the name of one of the three language groups.3 The Olah are Romany-speaking. The three language groups are Vlach, Romungro (which the claimant calls Hungarian Gypsy), and Beash.\nAsked to describe the differences between the three Roma groups the claimant said that the Olah were white, the Romungro black, and the Beash in between. In fact, fair-skinned Roma like the claimant are said to be very rare and are to be found, not among the Olah but among the Beash. Fair-skinned Roma comprise an estimated one percent of the total Roma population.4 Asked to discuss the differences between them, the claimant stated that they had different traditions but was unable to discuss those differences coherently or in detail when asked to elaborate. On occasion he would say that Romungro traditions were different from Olah and then be unable to describe those differences because, he said, he had never been to a Romungro function, a circular set of statements I find to make no sense.\nAsked what Roma cultural activities he participated in, he specified the Roma funeral celebration. However, when asked to describe it, even though he alleged to have attended them, he could give no more details than to say that the Gypsies would have a long celebration as usual and that everything happened in a manner as traditionally practised by Roma. I find the claimant to be misleading the panel by alleging that he has attended Roma funerals and knows about Gypsy customs.\nHe did not discuss events from an insider's viewpoint, but from an outsider's. He would describe the Roma as \"they,\" \"the Roma,\" and \"the Gypsies.\" I asked him why he did not speak about \"we Gypsies,\" and he replied that he did not like to speak that way because he had many problems as a result of his Gypsy identity. I find this to be a specious allegation designed to mask his misrepresentations.\nThe claimants stayed five months in the U.S. with the female claimant's father, who had settled in the United States after making a successful asylee claim in 1982-6. Yet they claim not to have discussed his successful claim with the father. Questioned why they did not, the male claimant said that they did not have good communications with each other and that the apartment was a big one and so they did not meet each other often. I find this explanation to be an implausible fabrication.\nThe male claimant also alleged that he did not make a claim in the U.S. because he did not know the process. He acknowledged knowing that his father-in-law had made an asylee claim, but said that his father-in-law's claim was for political reasons and not ethnic reasons. I find it improbable that the male claimant, if he had suffered severe discrimination or persecution, would not speak to his father-in-law about the subject because his father-in-law's claim was politically- rather than ethnically based. I find the male claimant's failure to discuss the asylee process with the father to indicate a lack of subjective fear.\nThe male and female claimant testified to very few incidents of discrimination and persecution, which made it all the more significant that they failed to mention in their PIFs that the female claimant's girlfriends opposed her marrying a Roma. I find this allegation to be an interpolation.\nThe female claimant's Declaration5 states that \"her husband ... did not have any problems with his previous employers or jobs\" prior to leaving for the U.S. I asked the male claimant about this and he acknowledged that the statement was a true one. I reminded him that he had been fired from his product-manager job prior to his 2001 American trip and asked him to explain the contradiction. He said that he did not have any problems so long as the first owner was there and only had problems after the first owner left (which was still before his American trip). I find that the claimant has contradicted himself on the subject of his employment discrimination and failed to explain that contradiction satisfactorily. Moreover, though he had worked at this position for some years, he claimed that he did not tell his wife what happened when he was fired. I find this latter allegation to be improbable.\nI asked the male claimant if he had asked anyone like Julia Urbani Lovell to supply him with a letter verifying that he was a Roma and he replied that he had not. I asked him why and he replied that he did not think it was important. I find his lax attitude towards furnishing the Board with proof of his ethnicity to reveal a lack of subjective fear.\nThe female claimant said in her SIO Declaration6 and in her oral testimony that she faced no problems in Hungary. She stated that she came to Canada to be with her husband. I therefore find that she faces no possibility of persecution if returned to Hungary at the present time.\nShe claimed to have known about her father's asylee claim prior to coming to the United States in 2001 but she did not discuss it with him when they visited him because she did not want to live in the United States. Asked to explain, she stated that her personality and her father's did not agree. Asked why she could not live elsewhere in the United States, she said that she could not because she had no relatives elsewhere.\nShe was asked to explain why it took five months to learn that she did not agree with her father and she replied that it took time to learn about his opinions. I find it improbable that the female claimant, during the extensive time period they were with the father, did not take advantage of the time during which good relations prevailed or could not overcome her dislike of her father's opinions to discuss an important subject like asylum with him. I find her failure to discuss it over a period of five months to indicate a lack of subjective fear.\nThe female claimant alleged that the male claimant did not tell her he was Roma and she never asked him. Rather, she figured it out herself. She heard it in his speech when they met. She saw the male claimant use his hands and speech in the expansive way that Roma do. I note in passing that the panel did not notice any expressive gestures on the part of the male claimant during his testimony. Although they discussed the problems that arose as a result of his being Roma in a hostile society, she never had a conversation with him confirming that he was Roma. I find these allegations to be implausible and one strong indication that this entire story is a fabrication concocted to ground a refugee claim.\nEvery subject canvassed revealed fresh improbabilities and implausibilities, contradictions and inconsistencies, until no evidence of the truthfulness of the claimants' story remained unrebutted or untainted. I find the claimants to be unreliable and untrustworthy witnesses in the matter of their own claims and their story to be a fabrication from beginning to end. As a result, I find that neither of the claimants is a Convention refugee as defined in section 96 of IRPA, or a person in need of protection as defined in section 97.\nNo Credible Basis\nThe claimants have failed to adduce credible evidence on which to base their claims. MacGuigan J. has stated in Sheikh:\n... in my view, even without disbelieving every word an applicant has uttered, a first-level panel may reasonably find him so lacking in credibility that it concludes there is no credible evidence relevant to his claim on which a second-level panel could uphold that claim. In other words, a general finding of a lack of credibility on the part of the applicant may conceivably extend to all relevant evidence emanating from his testimony.7\nIn this case, the claimants' lack of credibility extends to all relevant evidence emanating from their testimony. The panel is of the opinion that the claimants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection and that there is no credible or trustworthy evidence on which it could have determined that the claimants were either.\nWithdrawal Request\nJust prior to my completing these reasons (31 July 2003), it was brought to my attention that the claimants had notified the Registrar of the Board that they wished to withdraw their refugee claims. Section 52(1) of the RPD Rules states that:\nWithdrawal of a claim, or of an Application to Vacate Refugee Protection or of an Application to Cease Refugee Protection, is an abuse of process if withdrawal would likely have a negative effect on the integrity of the Division. If no substantive evidence has been accepted in the proceedings, withdrawal is not an abuse of process.\nIn this claim, the evidence has been heard and the decision written. Given the lack of merit in the claims, the panel regards an attempt to withdraw it at this time as a means of circumventing the Board's normal process and avoiding the negative implications and impact of an unfavourable decision. Were it to allow the withdrawal application at this late juncture, the panel finds that it would undermine the integrity of the Board.\nThe claimants' decision to withdraw their claims at this juncture fortifies the panel's findings that their claims lack a credible basis and have been put forward solely for an abusive purpose - that being to secure an extended stay in Canada for reasons unrelated to a need for asylum. For the reasons cited, and because the Board's jurisdiction under section 68 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act empowers it to determine its own jurisdiction, the panel has decided to issue its reasons, notwithstanding the claimants' submission of an application to withdraw.\nDETERMINATION\nI determine that XXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXX are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection as defined in sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and, pursuant to subsection 107(2) of IRPA, I find there to be no credible basis to their claims.\n\"S.M.

US Passports were produced for all of the claimants;1 accordingly, identity is not an issue in their claims. I am satisfied that the four claimants are all citizens of the US and of no other country.\n[2] The claimants were not represented by counsel at the hearing, although they had the benefit of counsel's assistance in the preparation of their Personal Information Forms (PIFs).2 Ms. Kubby was designated the representative for the two minor children.\nTHE GROUNDS\n[3] All four claimants are seeking refugee protection on several grounds.\n? MR. KUBBY'S CLAIM\n(a) Convention Refugee (IRPA Section 96)\n[4] Mr. Kubby is claiming to be a Convention refugee3 on the basis of his political opinion and his membership in a particular social group: patients who use cannabis medically (also referred to herein as \"medical marihuana patients\").\n96. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,\n(a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or\n(b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.\n(b) Person in Need of Protection (IRPA Section 97)\n[5] Mr. Kubby also claims to be a \"person in need of protection\" because he alleges that he would be jailed and denied the use of marihuana, which would put his life at risk, if he returned to the United States.\n[6] Section 97 provides:4\n97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\n(a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or\n(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\n(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\n(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\n(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.\n[7] Finally, he asserts that he fears a risk of torture pursuant to section 97(1)(a).\nII Ms. Kubby and the Minors' Claims\n[8] Ms. Kubby claims she is a Convention refugee on the basis that she is a member of a particular social group: Mr. Kubby's family. She claims, on behalf of the minor children, that they too are Convention refugees on the basis they are members of Mr. Kubby's family. She asserts that she and their two minor children are at risk of harm as set out in section 97.\nTHE ISSUES\n[9] The determinative issues of the claim are first, whether the claimants have a subjective fear of persecution, specifically in the light of their delay in making their claims. Second, whether, if a subjective fear is present, that fear is objectively well founded. Under this heading I will be canvassing the issues of state protection and prosecution versus persecution. If I am satisfied that the claimants have a well founded fear of persecution or are at risk of harm as set out in section 97 of IRPA, in Placer County in the State of California, I will canvass whether there is an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) to another part of the United States.\nTHE WITNESSES\n[10] The Board heard from a number of witnesses including journalist Patrick McCartney; California Superior Court Judge James P. Gray; marihuana activist Angel McCleary Raich; author Edward Rosenthal; British Columbia cancer specialist Dr. Joseph Michael Connors; California deputy district attorney Christopher Cattran; journalist Peter Edmund Brady; California defence attorney William Gary Panzer; Oregon Medical Marijuana Program manager, Mary S. Leverette and Washington prosecuting attorney (Chief of Staff) Daniel T. Satterberg. We also heard evidence from Mr. and Ms. Kubby. The claim was heard over the course of nine hearing days, between March 5, 2003 and April 16, 2003. Two conferences pursuant to Rule 205 were held, at which procedural and administrative issues were discussed.\n[11] Both the Minister's counsel and the claimants in their submissions used a similar Table of Contents to comment on the evidence. For reasons of consistency, I have followed generally the same format in these reasons for my decision. The analysis which follows, is regarding Mr. Kubby's claim. I will analyse the claims of his family immediately thereafter.\nSUMMARY OF THE EVIDENCE ADDUCED\n[12] According to the evidence,6 Mr. Kubby was able to smoke marihuana in California without incident for more than sixteen years (between the early 1980's when he began to use marihuana and when he was arrested in 1999), long before the passage of the Compassionate Use Act (CUA)7 in 1996.\n[13] Following a tip (an anonymous letter) on July 2, 1998,8 an investigation was launched into what the California state authorities believed was a marihuana grow operation in Placer County, at the Kubby residence. The letter alleged Mr. Kubby was growing approximately fifteen hundred plants and selling large crops of marihuana. Since cultivation remained a state offence following the enactment of the CUA, and following receipt of this letter, law enforcement in Placer County began an investigation of Mr. Kubby.9\n[14] Mr. Kubby allegedly retained the services of Robert Raich, Attorney-at-law who arranged for Mr. Kubby to be deputised as an agent of the City of Oakland, as a medical marihuana agent entitled to handle or possess medical marihuana for medical patients.10 We do not have documentary evidence showing that Mr. Kubby was in fact deputised, however I accept that he was. Mr. Kubby's standard of living appeared to police and prosecutors to exceed the Kubby family's apparent sources of income.11\n[15] A search warrant was approved by a judge and executed at the Kubby residence. The claimants allege the information provided to the judge who ordered the warrant, was incorrect and a fabrication. The trial judge made a pre-trial ruling with respect to the validity of the search warrant and Mr. Kubby's motion to suppress the search warrant. The motion to suppress was dismissed.12 The evidence obtained by the search warrant was considered as part of the claimant's criminal trial, in Placer County, California. Mr. Kubby appealed the trial judge's dismissal of his motion to suppress to the California Court of Appeal.13\n[16] In January 1999, state police and federal DEA executed a search warrant14 at Mr. Kubby's residence and found a two hundred and sixty-five plant indoor marihuana grow operation. Mr. Kubby was subsequently arrested, released on his own recognisance15 and together with his wife, charged with thirteen felony offences16 including cultivating marihuana, possession of marihuana for sale, conspiracy to cultivate marihuana, possession of concentrated cannabis, possession of mescaline, possession of psilocyn, possession of injection\/ingestion device, and unauthorised possession of hypodermic needle or syringe.\n[17] According to California deputy district attorney Christopher Cattran, the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) assisted with the search warrants due to \"manpower issues.\" A videotape of the execution of the warrant and seizure of evidence was filed in these proceedings.17 Mr. Cattran testified that he was told that the DEA was not interested in pursuing the Kubby case federally, and that they would defer to the state prosecution.18\n[18] Two hundred and sixty-five marihuana plants was far in excess of medical use based upon a police officer's expertise, and California State Prosecutor Christopher Cattran approved prosecution in the case.19\nContained within the search warrant was the fact that Mr. Kubby had some medical condition. That was taken into consideration as well; however it was determined that the amount was far in excess of a medical use.20\nVery few medical users can grow a sustainable supply without growing 20, 30 or 40 plants minimum. That is a typical garden. Twenty, 30, 40 plants. Sophisticated growers grow 100 or 200 if they're experimenting with varieties and so forth ...21\n[19] While in Canada pending the outcome of his refugee claim, Health Canada has given Mr. Kubby permission to grow one hundred and seventeen plants for medical purposes.22 Mr. Cattran testified that the standard required in Placer Country to prosecute a defendant in a state criminal Court, would be:\nwhether or not...the amount possessed, either in plants or off of plants, is reasonably related...to the person's then existing current medical condition.23\n[20] Mr. and Ms. Kubby were subsequently tried before a jury in the fall of 2000. Because this was a state, and not a federal prosecution, Mr. Kubby successfully avoided conviction on the marihuana related charges, by raising the defence of \"medical necessity\"24 provided for in the Mower25 decision and the Compassionate Use Act. Eleven of the jurors accepted Mr. Kubby's medical marihuana defence and voted in favour of acquittal. However, the judge was required to declare a mistrial because one juror held out for conviction.26 The prosecutors subsequently informed the Court that they would not be seeking to retry Mr. Kubby on the marihuana related charges.27 The effect of the prosecution's position resulted, in practical terms, in the end of the State's prosecution, at least on the marihuana charges.\n[21] However, with respect to the non-marihuana related charges, the jury convicted Mr. Kubby of possession of mescaline and psilocyn (counts 5 and 6). This despite Mr. Kubby's assertion that his possession of mescaline was for research for his book: \"The Politics of Consciousness,\" and was therefore \"protected\". He said he was told by someone that he could possess an \"unusable amount\" of mescaline, pursuant to the Religious Restoration Act of 1995.28 He alleged that the psilocyn was found in a guest room and he knew nothing about it or where it came from. The jury did not accept these explanations, and convicted him of the two non-marihuana drug offences.\n[22] Ms. Kubby was acquitted of all charges.29\n[23] Following his conviction on December 21, 2000, Mr. Kubby's matter was adjourned until March 2001 for sentencing.30 A pre-sentence report was prepared and a protracted sentencing hearing was conducted before Judge Cosgrove, who sentenced Mr. Kubby to 120 days of house arrest, a fine, and three years probation.31\n[24] The judge said, according to Ms. Kubby, that \"jail is not a place for [my husband].\"32 Possession of mescaline is a felony (the Canadian equivalent of an indictable offence) whereas possession of psilocyn is a \"wobbler\" (the Canadian equivalent of a hybrid offence). The judge chose to convict on the basis of a misdemeanour on the psilocyn as he was entitled to do, but erroneously reduced the conviction for possession of mescaline to a misdemeanour as well.\n[25] The Court directed that Mr. Kubby, who alleges that he has a medical need for marihuana, could use marihuana during his period of house arrest and probation, in accordance with the Compassionate Use Act (CUA).33 I think it useful to set out the full text of the Act.\nThe Compassionate Use Act of 1996\n[Proposition 215]\nSection 1. Section 11362.5 is added to the Health and Safety Code, to read:\n11362.5.(a) This section shall be known and may be cited as the Compassionate Use Act of 1996.\n(b) (1) The people of the State of California hereby find and declare that the purposes of the Compassionate Use Act of 1996 are as follows:\n(A) To ensure that seriously ill Californians have the right to obtain and use marijuana for medical purposes where that medical use is deemed appropriate and has been recommended by a physician who has determined that the person's health would benefit from the use of marijuana in\nthe treatment of cancer, anorexia, AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine, or any other illness for which marijuana provides relief.\n(B) To ensure that patients and their primary caregivers who obtain and use marijuana for medical purposes upon the recommendation of a physician are not subject to criminal prosecution or sanction.\n(C) To encourage the federal and state governments to implement a plan to provide for the safe and affordable distribution of marijuana to all patients in medical need of marijuana.\n(2) Nothing in this section shall be construed to supersede legislation prohibiting persons from engaging in conduct that endangers others, nor to condone the diversion of marijuana for nonmedical purposes.\n(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no physician in this state shall be punished, or denied any right or privilege, for having recommended marijuana to a patient for medical purposes.\n(d) Section 11357, relating to the possession of marijuana, and Section 11358, relating to the cultivation of marijuana, shall not apply to a patient, or to a patient's primary caregiver, who possesses or cultivates marijuana for the personal medical purposes of the patient upon the written or oral recommendation or approval of a physician.\n(e) For the purposes of this section, ''primary caregiver\" means the individual designated by the person exempted under this section who has consistently assumed responsibility for the housing, health, or safety of that person.\nSection 2. If any provision of this measure or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, that invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of the measure that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this measure are severable.\n[26] Following sentencing, the prosecutor moved for dismissal of the marihuana charges and appealed the judge's reduction of the outstanding charges to misdemeanours from\nfelonies. The prosecutor's appeal was successful and the charge regarding possession of mescaline reverted to a felony.34\n[27] In the meantime, Mr. Kubby tried to make arrangements35 to serve his period of house arrest or electronically monitored home detention in San Francisco36 rather than in Placer County because \"there is a more tolerant attitude and there are people that support [him] there.\"37 Both Placer County and San Francisco County approved Mr. Kubby for electronic monitoring in San Francisco County and set out the terms of the \"house arrest\".38 His period of house arrest was to begin on April 10, 2001.39\n[28] Mr. Kubby filed a cross appeal to the prosecution's appeal, on the grounds the search of his home was \"wrongful.\" The California Appeals Court held that the cross appeal could not be heard so long as Mr. Kubby was a \"fugitive.\"40 The Appeals Court determined Mr. Kubby became a fugitive when he knowingly fled the jurisdiction before he completed his sentence.\nOne who with knowledge that he is being sought pursuant to court process in a criminal action, absents himself or flees is a fugitive from justice. Accordingly, the defendant is, without question, a fugitive from justice. As such, and based on the rationale of the foregoing cases, he has forfeited his right to appeal his jail term while he flaunts it.41\n[29] In April 2001, Mr. Kubby filed additional materials seeking to amend his sentence to provide for treatment (pursuant to Proposition 36)42 rather than punishment. Although he had agreed to the terms of probation, he was no longer prepared to comply with the Probation Order.43 Mr. Kubby's motion was originally set to be heard on April 6, 2001, but it was later adjourned to April 27, 2001. Mr. Kubby's \"surrender date,\" the date on which he was to surrender himself to the Placer County Jail to begin serving his period in custody, either under house arrest or in jail, was extended to May 11, 2001.\n[30] A hearing was held to deal with Mr. Kubby's request that he be permitted to serve the time in jail rather than house arrest and probation. He felt that if he could have access to cannabis while in jail, this would be a better outcome than serving his time at home and being on probation for three years. He felt it would be too difficult to find a home to rent to serve his sentence. His family had by now moved to Canada to pursue business opportunities under NAFTA.44 He claimed to no longer have a residence in the US, even though he was only admitted to Canada temporarily. He objected to the three-year probation order because it\npermitted searches of his person, home and vehicle. He thought this would be subject to abuse by probation and law enforcement officials. His application for Proposition 36 relief was denied.45\n[31] On April 27, 2001,46 after considering the parties' submissions, Judge Cosgrove decided not to commute Mr. Kubby's sentence or terminate his probation.47 However, Judge Cosgrove extended Mr. Kubby's \"surrender date\" to July 20, 2001, at the request of jail staff who were awaiting some guidance from the United States Supreme Court as to what medical care could be provided to Mr. Kubby in jail if he chose to serve his period of custody in jail rather than under house arrest.\n[32] At the April hearing, a correctional official from the Placer County jail submitted to the Court that they not be asked to take Mr. Kubby to jail as they were unsure whether they could provide marihuana in the jail while Mr. Kubby served his sentence.48 They were awaiting the US Supreme Court's decision in the Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative49 case, which they hoped might give them some guidance on the issue.\n[33] Mr. Kubby's \"turn in\" date of July 20, 2001 was to be the day that the Electronic Monitoring Program (EMP) was to be set up. If that failed, he was ordered to turn himself in to Placer County jail officials.50 Mr. Kubby alleges he was given the Court's permission to go to Canada in April 2001, and he was not required to return to California until July 20, 2001. Ms. Kubby stated that he also received the permission of his probation officer to leave until July 20, 2001.51 This allegation is inconsistent with the court and probation documents filed.52\n[34] Mr. Kubby left the United States at the end of April 2001, and came to Canada before serving his period of house arrest and probation, while the details of how he would serve his sentence, were being resolved.\n[35] On July 20, 2001, Mr. Kubby failed to surrender himself to the Placer County jail as ordered. The Placer County Probation Department subsequently filed a petition for revocation of probation based on Mr. Kubby's failure to report to the county jail and on his change of residence without permission. On July 30, 2001, the judge issued a bench warrant for Mr. Kubby's arrest as a result of his violation of probation.53\n[36] To date, Mr. Kubby has neither paid his fines, nor complied with the terms of his probation. He has not served his jail sentence.54 Ms. Kubby testified that they were aware of the date, but made a conscious decision not to return for Mr. Kubby to serve his sentence.55 Mr. Kubby therefore has outstanding convictions in the United States for one misdemeanour and one felony.\n[37] In general terms, Mr. Kubby claims that he is a Convention refugee because he was prosecuted by the local authorities for his political opinion, namely his pro-marihuana beliefs. He alleges that because he was an outspoken activist, a former gubernatorial candidate, and well-known medical marihuana user, he was targeted by law enforcement officials and others.\n[38] In addition to his allegations about the state prosecution, Mr. Kubby also alleges that he is at risk of federal prosecution if he returns to the United States and that this prosecution would amount to persecution on the basis of his anti-government political opinion. He submits that any jail term imposed after a federal prosecution would constitute a risk to his life in that he would be denied the use of cannabis while serving his federal sentence, which would result in his death, thereby constituting cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nMR. KUBBY'S MEDICAL HISTORY\n[39] Mr. Kubby was diagnosed with adrenal (pheochromocytoma) cancer in 1968. When he was diagnosed with the disease, he was given only a few years to live, at most. In fact, he has lived for thirty-five years since his diagnosis. He believed, based on a medical diagnosis that he was going to die. After going through surgery to remove an aggressive tumour, chemotherapy and radiation, Mr. Kubby turned to non-traditional means to deal with his illness. He testified that he was \"preparing to die\"56 when a friend suggested he try marihuana to see if it helped with his symptoms. Since he has been in Canada, he has undergone radiation therapy in addition to the medical use of cannabis.\n[40] Dr. Connors, an expert in the area of adrenal cancers, and whose curriculum vitae57 suggests is highly knowledgeable in this area of medicine, testified at the hearing about Mr. Kubby's medical condition. According to Dr. Connors, Mr. Kubby's tumour releases, in excess quantities, hormones normally found in the adrenal gland that are called catecholamines. Excessive levels of catecholamines in Mr. Kubby's blood cause a range of separate symptomatic problems including paroxysmal headaches, sudden flushing or pallor of the skin, palpitations (rapid and irregular beating of the heart), hypertension (sudden dangerous rise in blood pressure), excessive sweating, sudden abdominal cramps and diarrhea, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, sudden severe weakness and anorexia (loss of appetite). If not controlled, Mr. Kubby's symptoms could evolve further to the point where a myocardial infarction (heart attack) or cerebral vascular accident (stroke) could occur.58\n[41] As previously mentioned, Mr. Kubby's cancer and related symptoms were treated for more than ten years by conventional means, including surgery, chemotherapy, radiation and medications. The life expectancy of a person with pheochromocytoma is usually three to five years.59\n[42]. In the early 1980s, Mr. Kubby began smoking marihuana and he stopped conventional treatments for his cancer and related symptoms. Mr. Kubby has not tried any conventional treatments for the symptoms of his cancer and related symptoms since he began using marihuana, except for radiation therapy while in Canada. Dr. Connors testified that it may take months to years to fully accomplish the radiation therapy, but there was no evidence that Mr. Kubby's tumour has responded to this therapy.60\nMR. KUBBY'S MEDICAL NEED FOR MARIHUANA\n[43] There is evidence before the Board, that marihuana controls the symptoms of Mr. Kubby's cancer, including hypertension.61 In Dr. Connors' opinion, marihuana continues to be the best treatment available to Mr. Kubby.62\n[44] The evidence is inconclusive as to whether Mr. Kubby's life would be at risk if he could not smoke marihuana to treat his symptoms, and was forced instead, towards conventional treatments. The Minister's counsel submits that the length of Mr. Kubby's survival is unusual but not unique. These are the words of Dr. Connors:\nHe has had a much longer than expected survival with this kind of medical problem than is usually seen, but it's not unique. There are recordings of other cases of equally long survivals and equally slowly progressive disease, as he manifests. 63\n[45] Bearing Dr. Connors' opinion in mind, it cannot therefore be stated with any degree of certainty, that marihuana is the reason for Mr. Kubby's survival even though it remains the best treatment option at this time. Mr. Kubby on the other hand contends that the length of his survival is unique in medical history and asserts that it was described by California cancer specialist Dr. DeQuattro as \"miraculous.\"64\n[46] These are the words of Dr. DeQuattro:\nFaith healers would term Steve's existence these past 10 - 15 years as nothing short of a miracle. In my view, the miracle, in part, is related to the therapy with marijuana.65\n[47] The Minister raises the point that Mr. Kubby's cancer and symptoms were treated by conventional means for approximately fifteen years, which is well past the average three to five years' life expectancy of a person with his type of cancer, suggesting that conventional means, at least while they were being employed, may have been successful in keeping him alive.\n[48] The only direct evidence from a doctor as to whether Mr. Kubby's life would be at risk if he could not use marihuana, is from Dr. Connors. His evidence was that cannabis has proven more effective than other medications in blocking the symptoms caused by Mr. Kubby's cancer. Because of this, Dr. Connors recommended that Mr. Kubby continue to use cannabis as his treatment to suppress symptoms.66 He also stated the opinion that cannabis is the best treatment available to Mr. Kubby.67 He did however concede that other medications, such as alpha and beta-blockers, might be able to control Mr. Kubby's symptoms but that marihuana appeared to be the best treatment.68\n[49] In 1999, Dr. DeQuattro evaluated Mr. Kubby's responses to marihuana therapy and evaluated his future need for treatment. He referred Mr. Kubby to Dr. Weiss, who assessed Mr. Kubby both before and after ingesting marihuana. Dr. Weiss concluded that Mr. Kubby's neuropsychological profile is \"indicative of intact to excellent cognitive functioning.\" She concluded that the \"most significant improvement demonstrated after his consumption of marihuana was reflected in both verbal and visual recall memory functioning.\"69 Dr. Weiss was not called as a witness in these proceedings to confirm whether Mr. Kubby's use of marihuana assists in his treatment of the cancer. Nor is it clear she would be capable of rendering such an opinion.\n[50] Unfortunately, Dr. DeQuattro died in an accident while on vacation in Hawaii70 and could not testify as to the results of his evaluation or provide a medical opinion about the risk to Mr. Kubby's life if he did not have access to marihuana. Witness McCartney testified that the email exchange71 between he and Dr. DeQuattro on July 7, 2001, was the \"last word\" from Dr. DeQuattro on the subject. In this exchange of emails between Dr. DeQuattro and Mr. McCartney, Dr. DeQuattro was persuaded that the use of marihuana helped Mr. Kubby with his symptoms. There is therefore, some evidence before the panel that marihuana has been effective in managing Mr. Kubby's symptoms and most likely, extending his life.\n[51] Mr. Kubby filed a journal article72 post-hearing on the anticancer effects of cannabinoids. The document was admitted on November 13, 2003. While I find the article is relevant to his claim, it does not raise new issues. The issue to be decided is not whether marihuana cures adrenal cancer, or any cancer, but whether it is a useful treatment in Mr. Kubby's case. I have found Dr. Connors' evidence compelling on this point, as stated previously. The journal article suggests that cannabis \"inhibits the growth of tumour cells in culture and animal models by modulating key cell-signalling pathways\".\n[52] The article cautions:\nRegarding effectiveness, cannabinoids exert notable anti-tumour activity in animal models of cancer, but their possible anti-tumour effects in humans has not been established.\nIt concludes that further research is required.\n[53] Given my assessment of his evidence and in the interest of finality, the Minister was not invited to make submissions on whether this document should be admitted.\nMARIHUANA LEGISLATION IN THE UNITED STATES\n[54] By way of history, it is helpful to understand the issues surrounding drug legislation and policy in the US, in order to appreciate what was happening at the time of Mr. Kubby's investigation and prosecution, and at present.\n[55] At that time and currently, there is a public debate in the United States over whether marihuana has any medical value and whether persons should be allowed to use marihuana for medical reasons. In California, Proposition 215, which passed in 1996 by way of a ballot initiative, was approved by a majority of California voters. The Compassionate Use Act73 (formerly Proposition 215) provides that the sections of the state Health and Safety Code prohibiting the possession and cultivation of marihuana \"shall not apply to a patient, or to a patient's primary caregiver, who possesses or cultivates marihuana for the personal medical purposes of the patient, upon the written or oral recommendation or approval of a physician.\"74\n[56] The intent of the legislation is clear: to exempt medical marihuana patients and their caregivers from criminal laws. No amounts were proscribed by statute nor can amounts be prescribed by a doctor, and there is no central registry of approved patients in California, as may be found in other states.75 The fact that limits have not been proscribed has caused problems for both law enforcement officials and medical marihuana patients. Interpretation of the statute has been left to a county-by-county guideline system, which is inconsistent amongst counties. Accordingly, enforcement and interpretation of who can possess and cultivate marihuana legally, has created friction.\n[57] Many guidelines have been recommended to ensure patients and caregivers are growing only what is necessary. For example, Dr. Mikuriya offered the following method for calculating a usable amount of marihuana:76\nTotal number of plants (T)\nMinus (- ) Number of Immature plants (I)\nMinus (- ) Number of Unsuitable Plants (u)\nEquals (=) Useable Number\nTimes (x) Height in Centimeters (H)\nTimes (x) Width (W)\nDivided by (\/) Density (D)\nMinus (-) Water (w)\nMinus (-) Lower Leaves and Stems (L)\nMinus (-) Seeds (S)\nEquals (=) Net Usable Amount\nDivided by (\/) Number of Strains (s)\nEquals (=) Actual Usable Amount (A) in grams\nThus: A={[T - (I + U)] x (H x W) \/ D - (w + L + S)} is (\/s)\n[58] The conclusion of Dr. Mikuriya was that a reasonable number of plants was fourteen. As it is readily seen by this formula, law enforcement would have had a very difficult task to establish what was reasonable in the circumstances. Not all marihuana patients agreed with this formula, and several others are found in the materials filed. Formulae, such as these did not advance the debate over what constituted a reasonable number of plants.\n[59] A new Bill was enacted by Governor Davis (California, Democrat) on October 13, 2003. Bill 420 comes into effect on January 1, 2004.77 It deals with many of the issues raised in this claim regarding cultivation, possession and transport of medical marihuana. Section 11362.71 permits a medical marihuana patient to possess a valid identification card and be immune from arrest and prosecution unless the card was obtained fraudulently.78\n[60] In addition, Section 11362.77 provides that a medical marihuana patient may possess eight ounces of dried marihuana and up to twelve marihuana plants. If the patient's doctor recommends that this does not meet the qualified patient's medical needs, the patient may possess an amount of marihuana consistent with their needs.79\n[61] The guidelines are intended to provide guidance for when police can make arrests.80\n[62] Sonoma County has enacted guidelines which allow three pounds and ninety-nine plants.81\n[63] The US federal government and the American Medical Association have determined that marihuana has no currently accepted medical use. Accordingly, the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA)82 still prohibits, among other things, the manufacture, distribution and possession of marihuana. The CSA also provides that marihuana is a Schedule I drug. Since a Schedule I drug has \"no recognised medical value,\" there is no defence of \"medical necessity\" against federal charges of possession or cultivation of marihuana,83 even where the marihuana is allegedly being grown pursuant to a state Act such as the Compassionate Use Act.\n[64] The CUA not only permits a person to raise their status as a qualified patient or caregiver at trial, but also permits a person to make a motion to set aside the charges against them before trial. This is significant because there is provision for the avoidance of a trial if the defendant can demonstrate medical necessity.\n[65] A person is only required to raise a reasonable doubt that they were in possession of, or cultivating marihuana for their personal medical purposes. It is not necessary that they prove this by a preponderance of the evidence. In other words, the defendant need only establish that the possession of marihuana is for medical reasons, and is using the substance pursuant to a doctor's recommendation.84\n[66] The CUA directly conflicts with federal law treating marihuana as a substance with no medical value and high potential for abuse. Drug busts of legitimate medical marihuana patients and Compassionate Use Clubs by DEA officials, followed the enactment of the CUA. Witness Patrick McCartney contended that the \"first strategy of law enforcement was to eliminate a public supply.\"85\n[67] The Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Co-operative was formed by the city of Oakland to grow and\/or distribute marihuana to approved medical users. The Federal government charged those who were distributing under the city's auspices, with federal offences, including distribution and trafficking in marihuana.\n[68] People like Edward Rosenthal, a witness in this claim, who were \"deputised\" by the city of Oakland to grow for third party patients, were not limiting themselves to possession and\/or cultivation for their own personal medical needs, as Mr. Kubby claimed he was. Several of the witnesses and US Court proceedings mentioned throughout this hearing are intertwined in ways large and small with the federal prosecution of the Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative. Mr. Kubby \"raised funds for them\" in their appeal before the US Supreme Court;86 Angel McCleary Raich was a buyer from this club, and her husband Robert Raich (whom Mr. Kubby retained in order that Mr. Kubby could likewise be deputised by the City of Oakland), was one of the Cooperative's attorneys.\n[69] All of the federal prosecutions mentioned were connected with third party distribution at one point or another. The US government sued to enjoin the Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative arguing it violated the CSA's prohibitions on distributing and manufacturing or possessing with intent to distribute a controlled substance. The Ninth Circuit Court ultimately recognised the \"medical necessity\" defence for the Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative but this decision was appealed to the US Supreme Court where it was overturned in May 2001.87\n[70] In evidence is the brief from the Department of Justice to the US Supreme Court arguing that the Ninth Circuit's decision was \"outrageous\" and of \"enormous legal importance\" since marihuana was a Schedule I substance with a high potential for abuse for which Congress had imposed an outright ban.88\n[71] In its decision, the US Supreme Court held that there was no medical necessity exception to the CSA's prohibitions on manufacturing and distributing of marihuana. The Court's decision does not overturn state law but prevents clubs and cooperatives from dispensing to third parties. Justice Clarence Thomas, for the majority, held that:\nthe Controlled Substances Act cannot bear a medical necessity defense to distributions of marijuana, we do not find guidance in this avoidance principle.89 [Emphasis added]\n[72] The Court held further:\nthis case does not call upon the Court to deprive all such patients [with medical marijuana recommendations] of the benefit of the necessity defense to federal prosecution, when the case itself does not involve any such patients.90 [Emphasis in the original]\n[73] Finally, the Court's reversal was on the basis that a \"distributor of marijuana does not have a medical necessity defense under the Controlled Substances Act.\"91\n[74] It is significant to note that the judgment does not deal with simple possession. Although the United States Supreme Court has spoken on the issue of clubs' distribution of marihuana for medical purposes, the debate regarding simple possession has not yet been litigated before it, nor has the issue of growing for personal medical use been decided by the Supreme Court.\n[75] In 2001, it was estimated that the number of persons using marihuana for medical purposes in California under the Compassionate Use Act ranged from twenty-five thousand to one hundred thousand. It has also been estimated that there are more than thirty organisations that distribute or dispense marihuana to persons for medical purposes currently operating in California.92\n[76] There are other examples of regulations enacted to deal with medical marihuana patients in the US. For example, Washington State permits a qualifying patient or designated primary caregiver to possess a sixty-day supply of marihuana.93 At least nine states have medical marihuana laws in place, where there has been a removal of criminal penalties.94 Many of the laws enacted in thirty-five states since 1978 are ineffectual due to the federal government's overarching prohibition.95 The debate has many supporters at all levels of government. A recent survey96 indicated that eighty percent of Americans think adults should be able to use marihuana legally for medical purposes and forty-seven percent say they have tried marihuana at least once. As the debate heated up, so did the confusion for lawmakers and enforcers. If federal law \"trumps\" state law, as we have heard repeatedly in the present case, how do state law enforcement agencies decide how much marihuana is too much for a grow operation, even if they are satisfied they are dealing with a bona fide patient with a doctor's recommendation?\n[77] Each state and county has developed its own guidelines, and some are more generous than others. What the Mower decision succeeded in doing was to ensure that those who were legitimately growing marihuana for their own medical purposes, could raise the medical necessity defence in a state prosecution. What it could not do, was reach into federal prosecutions and ensure the same protection and necessity defence could be raised in Federal Court. The confusion amongst the medical marihuana community became problematic for prosecutors and triers of fact.\n[78] The debate between federal and state jurisdiction grew and some claimed that medical marihuana patients were caught in the middle.97 There were images in the media of those purporting to be legitimate medical marihuana patients being arrested in a series of drug busts of Compassionate Use Clubs, in 2002 in California. According to at least one news article filed,98 the DEA was seen:\ndragging paraplegics and cancer patients who were legally growing pot, according to California statutes, to jail in a federal building in San Jose, for breaking federal law. \"I opened my eyes to see five federal agents pointing assault rifles at my head. 'Get your hands over your head. Get up. Get up.' I took the respirator off my face and I explained to them that I'm paralysed, \" said Susanne Pheil, 44 a paraplegic disabled by childhood polio.99\n[79] These images did not enhance the DEA's image with some of the American public. Mr. Kubby as a self-proclaimed \"med-pot activist,\" made it a point to communicate his disgust with federal and state officials when he ran for governor, and whenever he was in front of a microphone. He testified that he believed he was under surveillance for a long time, that authorities were aware he was growing marihuana, and he was targeted because he is an activist.\n[80] However, it is important to be mindful of the fact that despite the federal CSA not permitting persons to cultivate or possess marihuana for medical purposes, state laws allowing the medical use of marihuana still have real value because ninety-nine percent of marihuana arrests are made by state or local officials who enforce state or local laws, not federal laws.100 California and Washington have very generous and sympathetic state laws regarding the medical use of marihuana. In short, favourable state laws can effectively protect ninety-nine out of one hundred medical marihuana users who otherwise would have been prosecuted.101\n[81] It is clear that the medical marihuana debate is on-going in the US. Since the hearing into Mr. Kubby's claim, several important things have taken place which I feel are significant. Governor Davis signed Bill 420 which recognises that even prisoners may require guidelines to ensure medical marihuana is available for their use.\n[82] This Bill grew out of consultation with patient rights groups, medical cannabis growers, law enforcement officials, prosecutors and defence attorneys. Not all of these groups are satisfied with the Bill, however in the main, it has been lauded as a step forward for medical cannabis users.\n[83] It is clear that in the seven years since the CUA came into force the vexing question that has remained unresolved is: How much marihuana should a patient be allowed to possess and cultivate? It is not altogether clear whether Bill 420 will answer this question to the satisfaction of prosecutors or patients. Some medical marihuana advocates have thrown their weight behind the Bill, while more radical advocates have objected to any limits being placed on the amount a patient may possess or cultivate. Mr. Kubby submits there is no guarantee that Bill 420 will have any impact on his situation. What is clear is that the debate is far from over.102\n[84] In addition, the United States Supreme Court let stand a ruling by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeal in Conant v Walter, No 00-17222 (formerly Conant v McCaffrey, Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal), that doctors have a right to recommend or approve marihuana as treatment for their seriously ill patients. This ruling has been described as a major victory for medical marihuana patients. The ruling applies to nine states, including seven that have decriminalised the use of marihuana for medical purposes. California is one of the nine states affected.103\n[85] Doctors see this ruling as a favourable outcome which will permit them to have 'real conversations' with [their] patients about medial marihuana as part of their treatment option.104\n[86] In the Conant decision, the Court held:\nThe evidence supporting the medical use of marijuana does not prove that it is, in fact, beneficial. There is also much evidence to the contrary, and the federal defendants may well be right that marijuana provides no additional benefit over approved prescription drugs, while carrying a wide variety of serious risks. What matters, however, is that there is a genuine difference of expert opinion in the subject, with significant scientific and anecdotal evidence supporting both points of view.105\n[87] Mr. Kubby is not confident that Bill 420 will \"guarantee\" he will be permitted medical cannabis while in jail. As will be seen below, a \"guarantee\" is not required.106\nCONVENTION REFUGEE CLAIM PURSUANT TO IRPA Section 96\n(a) Definition and Burden of Proof\n[88] As set out above, section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act requires Mr. Kubby to establish a well founded fear of persecution.107\n[89] He must establish the facts of his case on a balance of probabilities. Once the facts are established on a balance of probabilities, he must show that there is a serious possibility of persecution for a Convention reason and that there is no state protection available. He must also establish that he does not have an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA). He is only required to show that there is \"more than a mere possibility\"108 he will be persecuted should he return to the United States.\n(b) Nature Of Mr. Kubby's Convention Refugee Claim\n[90] Mr. Kubby, is claiming that he is a Convention refugee because he was prosecuted by state authorities for his political opinion and further that his prosecution was persecutory. He alleges that he was targeted for harassment because he is an outspoken advocate for medical marihuana patients.\n[91] Mr. Kubby claims that his investigation and prosecution by Placer Country law enforcement officials under the state Health and Safety Code amounted to persecution. He compares his treatment by law enforcement in California, to the Nazi treatment of the Jews. He alleges that the court process is being used as cover for persecution.\nAnd, you know, during the Nazi regime every Jew got adjudicated, every trial was heard. You could have listed all these -- all these same kind of things could have been marshalled for any Jewish person that was sent to a death camp, because it is the appearance of justice without any real justice ever intended.109\n[92] He alleges the police harass medical marihuana patients because the police identify them as \"undesirable\". It appears to be Mr. Kubby's opinion that law enforcement officials are hiding behind the courts to harass and persecute those who advocate for medical marihuana patients.\n[93] In addition to his allegations about the state prosecution, Mr. Kubby also alleges that he is at risk of federal prosecution if he returns to the United States and that this prosecution would amount to persecution for his political opinion.\n(c) Subjective Fear\n[94] I am satisfied that Mr. Kubby has a subjective fear of being jailed in the US. I note that there was a significant delay between Mr. Kubby's arrival in Canada (May 4, 2001) and when he advised Canadian Immigrant Officials of his intention to seek Canada's protection as a Convention refugee (May 17, 2002). I do not find that this delay demonstrates a lack of subjective fear in Mr. Kubby's case. He had legal status when he arrived in Canada, and on the advice of counsel, believed that he lacked the circumstances required to make a successful refugee claim. I find this is a plausible explanation for the delay in making his refugee claim. In addition, I do not find delay determinative nor do I find it indicative of a lack of fear of persecution.\n[95] Therefore, Mr. Kubby has established a subjective fear of persecution in the US.\nCREDIBILITY\n[96] Mr. Kubby is passionate about his beliefs, including his belief that marihuana has saved his life. Dr. Connors testified that marihuana seems to be controlling his deadly adrenal cancer. It would have been helpful to have had one witness testify with greater certainty that what Mr. Kubby alleges is true - marihuana keeps him alive. Dr Connors came the closest to this without ever actually saying this was the case. In fact, it was Dr. Connors' evidence that any treatments that are available to Mr. Kubby medically in Canada would be available to him in the United States.\n[97] I do not think Mr. Kubby lied when he testified, and found him to be an intelligent, knowledgeable though at times, excitable witness. However, in my opinion, he was prone to exaggeration, and speculation. He made decisions he thought were reasonable in the circumstances such as leaving the US with outstanding, unresolved criminal convictions. However, the basis for his decisions, the underlying premises, have not been borne out by the facts.\n[98] An example of an exaggeration is the fact that the Kubbys appeared to take credit for Proposition 215 coming into force as the Compassionate Use Act. Witness Patrick McCartney on the other hand, testified that Mr. Kubby had a \"small but important\" role in it's passing. Ms. Kubby reiterated several times: \"I passed a law\"110 that would allow Mr. Kubby to smoke marihuana for medical purposes. Many people worked long and hard to enact the Compassionate Use Act, yet the Kubbys appeared at times to take most of the credit for its enactment.\n[99] Another example of exaggeration or mis-statement of facts is regarding Mr. Kubby's legal representation at his California criminal trial. Mr. Kubby alleges that he was let down by his court appointed public defender Ms. Mumma who allegedly refused to answer his or Mr. McCartney's calls. Mr.Kubby said that he had been left to his own devices while he was in Canada. He alleges he was effectively \"unrepresented\" in his California proceedings going on while he was here. A fair reading of the court transcripts111 demonstrates that Ms. Mumma was extremely persistent and diligent in raising defences and making submissions to the court regarding Proposition 36 relief - the limited purpose for which she was retained. Ms. Mumma may not have felt it appropriate, due to solicitor-client privilege to speak to Mr. McCartney. The transcripts filed demonstrate that Ms. Mumma was present and made submissions on Mr. Kubby's behalf on April 27, 2001 and on July 20, 2001, at a time Mr. Kubby testified he was no longer represented by her.112\n[100] An example of speculation is Mr. Kubby's belief that Mr. Lungren was involved in some way with the anonymous letter that began his prosecution. There is no evidence that this is true.\n[101] Another example of speculation (and there are others described below), is the fact that Mr. Kubby remains convinced federal DEA charges were looming on the horizon when he left the United States in 2001, yet none have materialised to date, some two years later (and four years after the original investigation). He believed he would be extradited from another state and indeed perhaps from Canada. In fact, no such proceedings have been commenced.\n[102] In addition, it was witness Satterberg's post hearing evidence that even with the change on the mescaline charge from a misdemeanour to a felony, it was his opinion that financial constraints would mean it was highly unlikely Mr. Kubby would be extradited from any other state to California.113 In addition, witness Cattran said there was no federal warrant outstanding for Mr. Kubby.114\n[103] The evidence suggests that Mr. Kubby's move to Canada was premature. Mr. Kubby is highly suspicious of US drug enforcement officials (particularly the DEA), yet rather than discuss with state authorities how much marihuana he required for medical purposes (including providing medical evidence of need), he chose to communicate his need for cannabis to the police while he was under surveillance, by leaving notes in his garbage which he believed would be intercepted by the police.\n[104] A Guide for Patients and Physicians in Washington State, demonstrates how a medical marihuana patient might deal with authorities if investigated by law enforcement. It is suggested:\n[t]hough the Act does not specifically prevent arrests, police officers are now being trained in ways to determine legitimate medical versus illegal, social use, when they discover a person with marijuana. You can make a police officer's job easier, and protect yourself, by carrying written documentation of your medical need for marijuana, including a copy of your doctor's authorising medical records.115\n[105] There was nothing stopping Mr. Kubby from attending the police station, the DEA or the District Attorney's (DA) offices, accompanied by his attorney, to tell them why he was growing so many plants and to elicit cooperation and develop a working relationship with law enforcement, as Angel McCleary Raich has done. He has powerful evidence with Dr. DeQuattro's and Dr. Connors' letters that could be given over to law enforcement officials to establish his need for medical marihuana. The fact is, Mr. Kubby did not do this. The investigation and prosecution that resulted, at least in Mr. Kubby's mind, was a conspiracy against him because he was an outspoken medical marihuana activist who ran alongside the State Attorney General for California, in the gubernatorial campaign. In my opinion, it was nothing more than the state authorities' attempt to satisfy their obligation to protect the public good from drug dealers.\n[106] I am in no way suggesting Mr. Kubby is a drug dealer. Quite the contrary. However, were we to step into the shoes of the police, it would be difficult to infer malicious intent.\n[107] I accept Mr. Kubby is ill with adrenal cancer, and that he has determined using marihuana is the treatment that works best with his particular symptoms. He has received a Health Canada exemption,116 which suggests he is a bona fide ill person in need of medical marihuana. It is noteworthy that Mr. Kubby was investigated and charged with marihuana related criminal offences in Canada. Those Canadian charges were later stayed by the Crown, and his marihuana grow equipment was returned to him by the RCMP after the charges were stayed. This suggests the Government of Canada believes he has a medical necessity for marihuana.117\n[108] His tendency to speculate and his exaggerated \"conspiracy theory\" notions aside, I find his testimony on the whole, to be generally credible. In summary, while I have concerns about Mr. Kubby's tendency towards exaggeration and speculation, there are no major credibility concerns.\nPROSECUTION vs. PERSECUTION\n(a) Introduction\n[109] Mr. Kubby argued that the criminal charges against him were politically motivated. He alleges that he had a role in the enactment of the Compassionate Use Act. When qualified patients continued to face arrest and prosecution after passage of the CUA, Mr. Kubby ran for the office of governor of the state of California. One of his opponents was Attorney General Daniel Lungren, the man Mr. Kubby believed had undermined the implementation of the CUA.\n[110] It is Mr. Kubby's belief that Mr. Lungren or others acting for him, had a role in the anonymous letter that began the prosecution. Mr. Kubby's local opposition to the actions of the DEA and state authorities allegedly did not make him popular in some law enforcement circles. The authorities' interest in him was likely prompted by his outspoken and vocal opposition on an issue that was controversial. Mr. Kubby was provocative, as he is entitled to be. He was exercising his constitutional right of free speech.\n[111] However, this does not lead me to find that the entire system of criminal justice in the US has been impeached in the manner envisioned by Satiacum.118 The issue I must determine is whether the prosecution against Mr. Kubby was politically motivated.\n(b) Fair and Independent Judicial System\n[112] It is clear that the United States is a democratic country with a system of checks and balances amongst its three branches of government: the executive branch, the legislative branch and the judicial branch. Mr. Kubby alleges the US system of government is not fair or independent, in part because it allegedly leads the world in incarceration of its citizens, although he filed no documentary evidence to support this assertion. In addition he relies upon the opinion\nof Judge Gray, a former US prosecutor and sitting superior court judge, as evidence to support this view. I will have more to say about the testimony of Judge Gray below.\n[113] According to the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal, a claimant must establish \"exceptional circumstances\" exist in his case such that one would be left to assume a fair and independent judicial process did not occur in his US criminal trial. Furthermore, the events leading up to Mr. Kubby's prosecution and his criminal trial must likewise be taken to be merged into the judicial system and are not open to review by a Canadian tribunal.\n[114] In order to rebut the presumption that the American judicial system is fair and independent, Mr. Kubby must provide evidence that tends to impeach the total system of prosecution, jury selection, and judicial oversight. He cannot pick and choose discrete indiscretions or illegalities by individual participants to demonstrate a failure of the entire system of government.119 Even if Mr. Kubby could prove that individual police officers or prosecutors abused their power, in my opinion, these isolated incidents would be subject to \"self-correcting mechanisms\"120 contained within the process itself. He has not demonstrated a failure of the entire system, nor has he established any persecutory intent on the part of law enforcement officials, prosecutors or judges in the state of California or elsewhere in the US.\n(c) Laws of General Application\n[115] I must presume that a law of general application, such as the California Health and Safety Code, is valid and neutral. The onus is on the refugee claimant to show that the law is inherently or for some other reason persecutory.121 No evidence was filed which would suggest that the state is in some way singling out Mr. Kubby for a Convention reason, in its application of the California Health and Safety Code. Mr. Kubby's anti-government political opinion is the reason alleged for abuse of his prosecution for alleged California Health and Safety Code violations. In fact, Mr. Panzer testified that in his opinion, as a criminal defence lawyer, the charges in the Kubby case were justified in the circumstances.122 Mr. Kubby alleges that Mr. Panzer's testimony would have been different had they been able to show him that the DEA report on Pete Brady was a lie.123 In my opinion, this would not have changed Mr. Panzer's evidence because he based his opinion on the number of plants found at the Kubby residence.\n[116] Mr. Kubby alleges that he is not contesting the California Health and Safety Code, but rather the failure, by the court system, to provide the necessary protection a bona fide medical marihuana patient such as Mr. Kubby requires to be safe from prosecution and conviction as a drug criminal. He argues that any system of law including California's is clearly unjust and persecutory, if seriously ill patients are being denied protection from police raids and are being blocked from accessing their medically approved therapy. While I do not take issue with this proposition, what the claimant fails to address is how he was denied access to approved therapy, after he was acquitted of marihuana charges. He has also failed to establish he would not be permitted the benefit of the exemption in the CUA with a doctor's recommendation, in future.\n[117] In my view, it is reasonable for the state of California to put restrictions on the use of medical marihuana. It is not reasonable for Mr. Kubby to assume the state should let him decide what amount is appropriate to cultivate and process. For example, in Canada, it is Health Canada that determines the number of plants he can grow. Likewise, in California he needed to persuade law enforcement that the amount he possessed was reasonable, given his medical need. Without clear guidelines, it was for Mr. Kubby to persuade prosecutors his grow operation was legitimate. He failed to do this, so a trial was the proper forum to litigate the issue.\n[118] There is no doubt in my mind that if the Compassionate Use Act had created a neutral body to determine the number of plants a patient is allowed to grow, medical marihuana patients would have fewer problems in the US. This was not done however, and I cannot re-write the CUA to deal with its perceived frailties.\n(d) Jury Trial\n[119] In addition to my comments above, the Minister's counsel submits that because Mr. Kubby was tried by a jury of his peers (meaning that the outcome of his trial was in the hands of his peers, not the police, the prosecutors or the judge), I should conclude that he received a fair trial. Mr. Kubby on the other hand, submits that the jury was not comprised of his peers from Placer County, since the prosecution succeeded in obtaining a change of venue. I find that the facts of the trial were decided nonetheless by a jury of his peers of US citizens. Mr. Kubby points to the trial of Edward Rosenthal as evidence of the unfairness of the system. Jurors in that case felt betrayed by the judge for not being told that Mr Rosenthal was growing marihuana for sick patients and was not a drug dealer. He ignores the fact that the lower courts are bound by the US Supreme Court's decision in the Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative and as such, the judge was precluded from permitting Mr. Rosenthal to advance the \"medical necessity\" defence because he was growing for others. In the end, Mr. Rosenthal received a one-day jail sentence.\n[120] Mr. Kubby alleges further that the prosecutors tried to improperly exclude persons from the jury, as further proof of bias and an unfair trial. However, there is no evidence to support his allegation and certainly no evidence that would tend to impeach the total system of jury selection or otherwise rebut the presumption of a fair and independent judicial system in the United States. To the contrary, the very fact that eleven of the jurors were in favour of acquitting him on his marihuana related charges demonstrates that the jury was not biased against him.\n(e) Right to Counsel\n[121] A careful reading of the court documents filed demonstrates that Mr. Kubby was asked at each appropriate juncture whether he wanted a court-appointed public defender. Sometimes he declined124 and other times, he accepted. He was represented much of the time by\nable counsel, and when he was not, it was his choice not to be. I find that he was extended the right to counsel as required by the US Constitution, for the entirety of his court process.\n(f) Independence and Impartiality of the Presiding Judge\n[122] With respect to the evidence adduced regarding the impartiality of the Judge who presided over Mr. Kubby's trial, from reading the documents filed, I am satisfied that Judge Cosgrove was independent and impartial and that Mr. Kubby's trial was fair. Mr. Kubby has previously acknowledged that he believed that Judge Cosgrove was independent and that he had acted fairly throughout his trial. During court proceedings on April 6, 2001, Mr. Kubby stated to Judge Cosgrove:\nI do believe that the judiciary is independent, and I believe that you have in your hand the key to ending this nightmare for my wife and my family and myself. 125\nI think that you are the kind of Judge, I think that you have shown throughout this whole trial, allowing us to look at whatever both sides wanted to come up, and there were times where we were unhappy, and I am sure there were times when the prosecution was unhappy, but you certainly have shown a willingness to look at the total picture.126\n[123] In addition to Mr. Kubby's admission, there is an abundance of other evidence indicating that Mr. Kubby was treated fairly by Judge Cosgrove and the other judges who have presided over his proceedings at various points. The Minister's counsel sets these out in his submissions:\na) Mr. Kubby was permitted to raise a full answer and defence to the charges against him, including raising the medical marihuana defence provided by the Compassionate Use Act, a defence which ultimately proved successful;\nb) Mr. Kubby was granted numerous adjournments of his trial to allow him to prepare his defence;\nc) Judge Cosgrove accommodated Mr. Kubby's medical condition by shortening the court day and allowing him to smoke marihuana on courthouse property during the trial;\nd) After Mr. Kubby had been convicted by the jury, Judge Cosgrove, over opposition from the prosecutors, reduced Mr. Kubby's charges from felonies to misdemeanors and directed that Mr. Kubby could continue to possess and use marihuana in accordance with the CUA while he was on probation; and\ne) Judge Cosgove sentenced Mr. Kubby to serve his jail time at home.\n[124] In the US, judges are elected officials and may only serve at the pleasure of the electorate. Judge Gray, one of the witnesses called by Mr. Kubby, is an elected judge in California, and is a good example of the independence of the American judiciary. He has maintained his position as a judge even though he has been a public critic of American drug policies for years. He apparently is not fettered by his position from expressing his opinion on US drug policy.\n[125] In addition, I find it noteworthy that the federal judge who presided over Mr. Rosenthal's marihuana trial, sentenced Mr. Rosenthal to a jail term of one day and ordered that it be time served. This, even though the federal prosecutors had been seeking a six-year jail sentence for Mr. Rosenthal, demonstrates that on balance, the system is independent. It would appear that the judge, by imposing this sentence, did what he was precluded in law from doing in the trial.\n[126] It seems Mr. Kubby believes the only just recourse would have been for the judge presiding over his drug trial to order state and local law enforcements to keep their hands off of the Kubby medical marihuana garden and permit Mr. Kubby to grow as much marihuana as he feels he needs to stay alive. Anything short of this seems to be labelled \"unfair\". Mr. Kubby compares his medical need for cannabis to a diabetic who needs insulin. \"No judge would deny a diabetic their insulin\" he submits. The distinction is clear: insulin has been approved by the medical community as a treatment for diabetics, whereas marihuana has not. The research on the benefits of marihuana is woefully inadequate and inconclusive, making a comparison of these two treatments illogical.\n[127] In his submissions he argues:\nThe judge should have handed Mr. Kubby a court order spelling out exactly how many plants he could grow safely, without having to worry about another raid. Instead, he placed Mr. Kubby and his family in the direct line of fire of law enforcement by putting him on three years of probation. Law enforcement had carte blanche to come into Mr. Kubby's life and judge whether he and his family were living up to police standards or not.127\n[128] Mr. Kubby lacks an understanding of judicial limitations. The trial judge was deciding a criminal case, not setting guidelines for how much marihuana he could grow. The number of plants found at the Kubby residence warranted the laying of charges, as his own defence lawyer, Mr. Panzer, conceded. I am not persuaded by Mr. Kubby's argument with respect to a lack of due process regarding his criminal prosecution in California. It is clear to me from the evidence adduced in this case, that Mr. Kubby was given a fair trial in the US.\n(g) Alleged Risk of Federal Prosecution\n[129] Mr. Kubby is alleging that he is at risk of a federal prosecution either for his past or future actions. Several witnesses gave their opinion that Mr. Kubby would be prosecuted by the federal authorities if he returned to the United States. Mr. Kubby argues that if he were prosecuted on federal drug charges, he would be denied the right to advance the \"medical necessity\" defence he is afforded under the CUA for state prosecutions. His fear is that his continued need for marihuana will cause him to eventually run afoul of federal laws by growing and cultivating marihuana. He fears he will expose himself inadvertently to a federal prosecution thereby inviting a lengthy sentence at the end of a successful prosecution.\n[130] Clearly it is against federal law in the United States to cultivate and use marihuana for any reason. Accordingly, Mr. Kubby would be committing a federal offence if he were to grow and\/or cultivate marihuana outside of the protection afforded in the CUA.\n[131] However, the evidence on the whole indicates that the DEA's focus is on large scale drug trafficking. As we have heard repeatedly in this hearing, the DEA does not generally get involved in minor drug investigations and prosecutions, largely because of limited resources. Mr. Satterberg testified:\nI spoke this morning with [DEA] chief criminal deputy there, and there are no specific guidelines. They are pretty flexible about what cases that they look at... they typically will not handle a case unless it's at least 500 plants or\/and at least 50 pounds of processed marihuana. Those are kind of general guidelines that they follow ... they are interested in getting drug traffickers.128\n[132] On the one hand several witnesses expressed their opinion that Mr. Kubby would likely be prosecuted by the federal authorities because he was a high profile marihuana advocate. Based on this evidence, Mr. Kubby alleges that he is at significant risk of being prosecuted by the federal authorities if he returns to the United States.\n[133] On the other hand, there was also evidence that some prominent marihuana advocates have not been charged by the DEA. Angel McCleary Raich, who described herself as a medical cannabis activist,129 was a most compelling and articulate witness. She has several caregivers who are responsible for growing 500 marihuana plants for her use. She testified that she and her caregivers have not been investigated or prosecuted by the federal authorities, although she lives in fear the day will come when the federal DEA will come for her. In part to deal with this fear, she has established a good rapport with local law enforcement. She did however add that the identity of her caregivers is kept secret to protect them from prosecution. It is not clear from the evidence what Ms. McCleary Raich fears, given she has never been targeted by law enforcement and maintains a good relationship with them. It is a non-specific, generalised fear that she describes, because she is ill and therefore vulnerable.130\n[134] The testimony of Mr. Satterberg directly contradicted the opinion expressed by some witnesses that Mr. Kubby would be prosecuted by the federal authorities because of his political opinions. It was his evidence that the federal government authorities do not have a policy on medicinal marihuana patients and it is not their practice or intent to try to prosecute a medicinal marihuana case simply to make some sort of political point.131 Of course, he was describing his relationship with federal prosecutors in Washington state and was not expressing an opinion on what the DEA's position might be in California.\n[135] However, it is noteworthy that the DEA is a federal institution and one would assume that theirs is a national policy. What Mr. Satterberg was saying about Washington state would likely be their drug policy throughout the US.\n[136] By way of example, the city of Seattle Vice and Narcotics Section Commander wrote to the US Department of Justice, seeking clarification of consequences to police officers who returned medicinal marihuana seized pursuant to drug investigation, if a recommendation by a doctor was verified. The police were concerned that by returning a Schedule I controlled substance (marihuana) they would be in violation of federal law.132\n[137] The US Attorney responded that while Washington State's medical marihuana initiative was clearly in conflict with federal laws prohibiting cultivation, possession, distribution of marihuana, and drug control policies of their Administration (that legalised medical use of controlled substances should be based on medical research) they understand that the conflict between state and federal laws puts the Seattle Police Department in an \"uncomfortable position.\"133\n[138] Speaking for the US Department of Justice, the Attorney stated:\nGiven our limited funding and overwhelming responsibilities to enforce an ever larger number of federal offenses, we simply cannot afford to devote prosecutive resources to a case of this magnitude.\n[139] In short, she would decline to prosecute, and confirmed they have no interest in the police investigating and forwarding cases involving medical marihuana patients\n[140] The federal authorities did not handle Mr. Kubby's prosecution at the time he was arrested. One would think that if they were interested in doing so, the time to have done this would have been when he was arrested in 1999. At that time he was a prominent medical marihuana advocate. He had recently finished his campaign to become the Libertarian governor of California and during that campaign, he had publicly criticised drug polices in the United States and supported the legalisation of marihuana. Despite Mr. Kubby's public profile as a marihuana advocate and the DEA involvement in the execution of the warrant at his residence, he was not charged federally. Nor has he been charged federally since his acquittal on state charges in the US.\n[141] Moreover, there is no evidence that the federal authorities have taken any steps to lay federal charges against Mr. Kubby following his acquittal on state marihuana charges. Several witnesses alleged that they had heard that a federal prosecutor wanted to arrest Mr. Kubby, but there is no evidence to support these allegations. Even Mr. Kubby appeared to acknowledge that he had no evidence that the federal authorities intend to revive the charges against him. 134\n[142] It has been four years since Mr. Kubby was arrested in California. I do not have any evidence the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration is interested in him today. Gerald Uelmen, a Professor of Law at Santa Clara University Law School who was involved in both the Mower case before the Supreme Court of California and the Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative case before the United States Supreme Court, has stated that the federal government has never prosecuted a cancer or AIDS patient for simple possession of marijuana for personal use and expressed his opinion that it never will, because government officials realise no jury would ever convict in such a case.135\n(h) Fugitive From Justice\n[143] Mr. Kubby urges me to find that he is not a fugitive from justice, but rather a victim of arbitrary arrest and prosecution, the result of which was a jail term, which he alleges will cause his death, if he is forced to serve it in a prison. In his submissions, Mr. Kubby alleges that the allegation that he is a fugitive has never been adjudicated in the US and that in Canada, where it has, the Immigration Adjudicator ruled that Mr. Kubby entered Canada legally and is not a fugitive.136 On July 30, 2001, a bench warrant was issued in California for Mr. Kubby's arrest, as a result of his violation of probation. Accordingly, I agree with the characterisation of Mr. Kubby as a fugitive from US justice, notwithstanding the fact that he entered the country legally. In addition, Judge Kolkey of the California Court of Appeal made the finding that Mr. Kubby is a fugitive.137\n[144] Mr. Kubby also urges me to accept that he is a victim of a justice system whose priorities, for reasons of his political opinion, have gone astray. That in its aim of eradicating drug use and thereby prevailing in the \"War on Drugs,\" it has ignored its own US Constitution and trampled on individual civil liberties. He expects that the commission of an offence, in this\ncase the failure to appear in Court to serve his sentence, coupled with fleeing the jurisdiction contrary to the terms of his probation order, should not automatically lead to the conclusion that his fear is of prosecution and punishment, rather than of persecution on one of the grounds specified in the definition.\n[145] Having made the finding that Mr, Kubby is a fugitive from justice, it is important to draw a distinction between a \"fugitive\" and a \"refugee\" facing persecution. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has considered this distinction in its handbook.\n... a fugitive from justice [may] not use the Convention as a shield, and therefore abuse the Convention refugee process. 'Persecution must be distinguished from punishment for a common-law offence. Persons fleeing from prosecution or punishment for such an offence are not normally refugees. It should be recalled that a refugee is a victim, or potential victim, of injustice, not a fugitive from justice.'138\n(i) Summary\n[146] Despite his impassioned evidence, Mr. Kubby has failed to demonstrate that he did not receive a fair trial in California. In my view, he was afforded numerous procedural and substantive legal rights in the United States. Mr. Kubby submits that his witnesses, some of whom are similarly situated to him, have demonstrated the shortcomings of the US judicial process. What is clear to me from reading the cases that have come out of the US Courts of Appeal, and the US Supreme Court, and carefully listening to the witnesses who have testified in this case, is that matters are being considered and judgments are being made on the issue of medical use of marihuana in the United States. The debate is still very much alive.139\n[147] The fact that the outcome does not always please the litigants is not evidence of bias, unfairness, breach of Constitutionally protected rights, or persecution. It is evidence of an on-going debate in a politically charged area of the law: that is, the issue of the use and abuse of marihuana for medical reasons. The sad reality is that this in an area of law subject to abuse by drug users, traffickers, and those who would benefit from taking advantage of the medical marihuana laws, to the detriment of legitimately ill and dying patients.\n[148] The marihuana debate is underway in many countries today, including Canada, and it will not be easily or quickly resolved. Based upon the documents filed, Mr. Kubby was given a fair and impartial trial in the US and was afforded multiple avenues of appeal. He has therefore failed to establish that the trial process was not fair. He has likewise failed to establish the process was persecutory.\n[149] I reject his evidence that he was the victim of a \"witch hunt\" by prosecutors, law enforcement officials and judges. I prefer the evidence of a lack of persecution presented by the witnesses of the Minister's counsel because their evidence, coupled with the documentary evidence filed, demonstrates that the United States government is bound by its Constitution and affords legal protections where individual rights are concerned.140\n[150] Although the Preamble of the US Constitution is not a source of power for any department of the Federal Government, the US Supreme Court has often referred to it as evidence of the origin, scope, and purpose of The Constitution. The Fifth Amendment guarantees a person the right against self-incrimination and double jeopardy in a criminal proceeding. The Sixth Amendment affords an accused person a \"speedy and public trial, by an\nimpartial jury of the State and district wherein crimes shall have been committed ... and to be informed of the nature of the [crime] and to have the assistance of counsel for his defence.\" 141\n[151] I find that the US Constitution and its entire system of justice, are devised to afford individual civil liberties, and extensive fundamental rights.\n[152] As noted above, with the exception of one brief period following his arrest in January 1999, Mr. Kubby has been able to use marihuana in the United States for more than fifteen years without incident. Even following his arrest, Mr. Kubby was able to continue smoking marihuana without any interference by law enforcement even though he alleges he was forced to purchase marihuana illegally. Furthermore, during his trial, the Court facilitated Mr. Kubby's use of marihuana.\n[153] While I accept Mr. Kubby fears returning to the US to serve out his sentence, I do not accept that his fear is objectively well founded. It is clear to me that Mr. Kubby and some of his supporters, have lost faith in the judicial process in the US. There has been much written about the federal versus state mandates in the \"War on Drugs\", that has been unflattering to the Federal \"drug Czar\"142 and the DEA. There is no doubt that the US must reconcile two opposing legal doctrines: the states that have passed Compassionate Use Acts (or their equivalent) as against federal laws which declare that possession of a Schedule I drug should net the convicted felon substantial jail time. In the words of the United States Attorney, this is a \"complex and contradictory area of drug enforcement.\"143\nAVAILABILITY OF STATE PROTECTION\n[154] There is a requirement in the definition of Convention refugee that the claimant be unable, or by reason of his fear of persecution, unwilling to avail himself of the protection of the country of nationality (citizenship), in this case, the United States. The Supreme Court of Canada in Ward extensively canvassed the issue of state protection.\nHaving established that the claimant has a fear, the Board is, in my view, entitled to presume that persecution will be likely, and the fear well-founded, if there is an absence of state protection. The presumption goes to the heart of the inquiry, which is whether there is a likelihood of persecution. ... Having established the existence of a fear and a state's inability to assuage those fears, it is not assuming too much to say that the fear is well founded. Of course, the persecution must be real - the presumption cannot be built on fictional events - but the well-foundedness of the fear can be established through the use of such a presumption.144 [Emphasis added]\nAlthough this presumption increases the burden on the claimant, it does not render illusory Canada's provision of a safe haven for refugees. The presumption serves to reinforce the underlying rationale of international protection as a surrogate coming into play where no alternative remains to the claimant. Refugee claims were never meant to allow a claimant to seek out better protection than that from which he or she benefits already.145\n[155] The state's ability to protect the claimant is a crucial element in determining whether the fear of persecution is well founded, and as such, is not an independent element of the definition. The issue of state protection goes to whether the fear of persecution is objectively well founded.\n[156] The claimant has come to Canada seeking refugee protection. The responsibility to provide international protection only becomes engaged when national or state protection is unavailable to the claimant. This is referred to in Ward as \"international\" or \"surrogate\" protection. If the state in question is able to protect the claimant, then his fear is not, objectively speaking, well founded.\n[157] Moreover, except in situations where the foreign country is in a state of complete breakdown, states must be presumed capable of protecting their citizens. This presumption can be rebutted by \"clear and convincing\" evidence of the state's inability to protect. The danger that the first presumption (set out above), will operate too broadly, is tempered by a requirement that clear and convincing confirmation of a state's inability to protect must be advanced.\nAbsent some evidence, the claim should fail, as nations should be presumed capable of protecting their citizens. Security of nationals is, after all, the essence of sovereignty. Absent a situation of complete breakdown of state apparatus, such as that recognized in Lebanon in Zalzali146 it should be assumed that the state is capable of protecting a claimant. [Emphasis added]\nThe quantum of clear and convincing evidence required to rebut the presumption of a state's ability to protect will depend on its democratic processes.147\n[158] Mr. Kubby adduced evidence of similarly situated individuals whom he alleges have been let down by the state protection arrangements. He alleges that the state is singling out medical marihuana users for abuse and endangering their lives thereby. He argues the state cannot or will not protect him from the ambiguity of the laws in the US.\n[159] In Satiacum, the Federal Court of Appeal held:\nIn the absence of exceptional circumstances established by the claimant, it seems to me that in a Convention refugee hearing, as in an extradition hearing, Canadian tribunals have to assume a fair and independent judicial process in the foreign country. In the case of a non-democratic State, contrary evidence might be readily forthcoming, but in relation to a democracy like the United States contrary evidence might have to go to the extent of substantially impeaching, for example, the jury selection process in the relevant part of the country, or the independence or fair-mindedness of the judiciary itself. [Emphasis added]\n[160]\nIn Kadenko,148 the Federal Court of Appeal noted that the burden of proof to establish the absence of state protection is:\ndirectly proportional to the level of democracy in the state in question. The more democratic the state's institutions, the more the claimant must have done to exhaust all the courses of action open to [him].\n[161] The claimant bears the burden at all times of rebutting the presumption that the state is capable of protecting its citizens. Decisions following Ward have established that state protection need not be perfect.149\n[162] A review of Satiacum150 is helpful to the analysis of whether the claimant's subjective fear of persecution is objectively well founded because the facts of that case have similar elements to the present case. In that case, a Hereditary Chief from Tacoma Washington, Robert Satiacum, made the claim that he was a Convention refugee and could not obtain the protection of the US government.\n[163] In May 1982, Mr. Satiacum was indicted and, after a trial with a jury, Mr. Satiacum and two other co-accused were found guilty. He was never sentenced because he fled to Canada while out on bail awaiting sentencing, therefore, he was not present when his co-accused were sentenced.\n[164] Mr. Satiacum was arrested in Canada in 1983 and claimed refugee status. In a 77-page decision, the Immigration Appeal Board (IAB, as it then was) rendered a split - decision. Two of the three Members determined Mr. Satiacum was a Convention refugee. Pursuant to the law at the relevant time, this resulted in a positive determination of Mr. Satiacum's claim. The third panel Member dissented, and held that Mr. Satiacum did not have a well founded fear of persecution, in part based on the fact the US was a democracy and therefore the claimant's fear was not objectively well founded.\n[165] Mr. Satiacum feared being murdered while in jail serving his sentence on criminal charges. The IAB held this fear was reasonably justified, both for the past and in the present.\n[166] They arrived at this conclusion based on the evidence adduced at the hearing. It was not suggested that the US government took an active role in the persecution, but it was alleged the government could not protect him.\n[167] The Board relied upon Rajudeen151 and Surujpal152 and held:\nIt is not necessary to the success of the applicant's claim that active harassment by federal authorities be shown, as long as they were shown to be unable or unwilling to effectively protect the applicant.\n[168] A majority of the IAB held there was an objective basis to Mr. Satiacum's fear of persecution because the federal government did not protect him against strong and vocal state interests, which he challenged. It is significant that the panel did not know the reason for the inactivity by federal officials, since there was no evidence tendered, either way. The IAB found that Mr. Satiacum feared for his life if incarcerated in a federal prison.\n[169] The Federal Court of Appeal held that the degree of risk, or likelihood of persecution was that established in Adjei.153\nWhat is evidently indicated by phrases such as \"good grounds\" or \"reasonable chance\" is, on the one hand, that there need not be more than a 50% chance (i.e., a probability), and on the other hand that there must be more than a minimal possibility. We believe this can also be expressed as a \"reasonable\" or even a \"serious possibility\", as opposed to a mere possibility.\n[170] For this reason, Mr. Justice MacGuigan, speaking for the majority in Satiacum, held that Rajudeen was inappropriately applied to the facts of Mr. Satiacum's case. In Rajudeen there was illegal and violent harassment by intolerant majorities with police acquiescence or indifference, which amounted to state complicity in the persecution. In both Rajudeen (Sri Lanka) and Surujpal (Guyana) there was no federal state (as in the US) and there was no judicial system in play.\nBoth cases clearly deal with the kind of law enforcement, which may amount to persecution. Neither relates in any way to the judicial process, let alone to a fair and independent judicial process. The Board majority therefore erred in law in applying Rajudeen to the facts in the case at bar.154\n[171] The Federal Court was clear in its guidance:\nAgain, in the absence of proof by the refugee claimant, Canadian tribunals must assume a fair trial. The notion of a fair trial in a fair and independent judicial system must make allowances for the self-correcting mechanisms within the system, e.g., the trial judge's control over the excesses of the participants, and the control of the appellate Courts over any errors of the trial judge.\nIn all but the most extraordinary circumstances all the events leading up to a prosecution and all of the events of a trial in a free and independent foreign judicial system must be taken to be merged into the judicial process and not open to review by a Canadian tribunal. Extraordinary circumstances would be those, for example, which tended to impeach the total system of prosecution, jury selection or judging, not discrete indiscretions or illegalities by individual participants which, even if proved, are subject to correction by the process itself.155 [Emphasis added]\n[172] In Ward, the Supreme Court of Canada, commented on Satiacum:\nThe Federal Court of Appeal's disposition in Satiacum may best be explained as exemplifying such a case of presumption of a state's ability to protect and of objective unreasonability in the claimant's failure to avail himself of this protection.\n[173] Whether one applies the reasoning of Satiacum (decided before Ward) or the presumption set out in Ward, it amounts in effect in the same result.\n[174] Canadian tribunals must assume a fair and independent judicial process in a foreign democracy such as the United States. Mr. Kubby, through his evidence, has attempted to demonstrate that the US Federal Government, through its Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), post September 11, 2001 and under the Bush administration, has become non-democratic. I do not find this amounts to the \"exceptional circumstances\" envisioned in Satiacum.\n[175] Although Mr. Kubby and his witnesses were passionate when they testified that the United States is no longer a democracy, and is denying the most fundamental of rights to patients who use cannabis medicinally,156 insufficient evidence has been advanced to support this assertion, in Mr. Kubby's specific case.\n[176] In the present case, the claimant has failed to establish there exists \"exceptional circumstances\" that would warrant international protection. \"Exceptional circumstances\" do not exist in relation to the search of Mr. Kubby's home, nor in the charges which followed that search. The state of California charged Mr. Kubby with cultivation and conspiracy - very serious charges - as well as other drug-related offences arising from his marihuana grow-operation. Law enforcement believed he was growing too many plants to be a bona fide medical marihuana user. Witness Patrick McCartney testified there were no limitations on plants grown and possessed, in the Compassionate Use Act, by \"design,\" and they were \"vague\".157 Mr. Kubby alleges he stuck to the \"Oakland Guidelines\"158 on the number of plants he could grow. These Guidelines have been amended since Mr. Kubby's arrest,159 and Bill 420 which comes into force in January 2004 would radically change the guidelines for medical marihuana patients.160 Because the instructions to law enforcement in 1999 were vague, the proper procedure when in doubt, was to have a deputy district attorney make the call, which happened in Mr. Kubby's case. Prosecutor Christopher Cattran attended the Kubby residence when the warrant was executed161 and made the decision that charges were reasonable in the circumstances. He was aware that Mr. Kubby intended to raise the defence of medical necessity. The recourse Mr. Kubby had was to the courts. Both Mr. and Ms. Kubby were provided the full benefit of due process, the result of which is that they no longer face any marihuana-related charges. In effect, the process worked, as it was designed to. I do not wish to minimise the trauma and expense to the Kubbys of such a process, however, I am guided by law, and do not have the mandate to apply humanitarian and compassionate considerations.\n[177] The United States has a court system which is very similar to Canada's. There are safeguards built into the justice system - the right to counsel, the right to remain silent, the right against self-incrimination, are some examples. Satiacum stands for the proposition that the Refugee Protection Division must be extremely careful when dealing with cases from a democracy such as the United States, before affording international protection. Even where, as here, there are allegations of an abuse of power or authority within the democracy, it is necessary to be mindful of \"self-correcting mechanisms\". In this case, Mr. Kubby had able counsel representing him and he had full appeal rights, some of which he exercised. Prosecutors and law enforcement officials are subject to complaints procedures that Mr. Kubby could have used if he felt there was an abuse of power or process.162\n[178] The state law enforcement officials are responsible for criminal charges in drug cases where the seizure is for a smaller number of plants than the Federal DEA would be interested in prosecuting. Several minimum numbers of plants were discussed, and it is not entirely clear in which cases the DEA would determine their intervention was necessary. However, the prosecutor in the case, Mr. Cattran testified that somewhere around one thousand plants might be needed to involve the limited resources of the DEA. Mr. Satterberg said less than five hundred plants or fifty pounds of dried marihuana would likely not result in federal prosecution. Mr. Kubby seems to concede this in his submissions.\nIt is well known in criminal justice circles that federal prosecutors are only interested in pursuing cases involving more than 500 plants or 1000 plants in some jurisdictions.163\n[179] Around two hundred and sixty-five plants were seized from the Kubby residence, well below the number of plants that would be of concern to the DEA. While it was the DEA who executed the warrant at the Kubby residence, it was clear from a review of the videotape164 of that search, that the DEA was interested in the preservation of evidence, not in persecuting Mr. Kubby. After the seizure, the investigation was handed over to the state authority. There is no evidence of an on-going interest by federal authorities, in Mr. Kubby's case, as he alleges. The significance of this is that Mr. Kubby testified that he would be precluded from raising the defence of \"medical necessity\" in a federal prosecution and as I have already noted, he has failed to establish he is likely to face federal prosecution.\n[180] The problems between the enforcement of state medical marihuana laws and the Federal DEA's interest in abolishing drug trafficking and possession are not mutually exclusive. They can co-exist with cooperation between the two departments. Mr. Satterberg testified this is the case in King County.\n[181] The United States government has grappled with this dichotomy, between federal and state powers, and many legal minds have turned their attention to the issues involved.165\n[182] Mr. Kubby chose to leave the US after all of the criminal charges against him and his wife had been prosecuted, and a sentence rendered. He took extraordinary steps to ensure he received approval for electronic monitoring and could therefore serve his sentence in the comfort of his home, in order that he might medicate with marihuana, as he needs to. His objection to the sentence was in part due to the imposition of a three-year term of probation, one of the terms of which would permit his probation officer to search his home if illicit drug use was suspected. This Probation Order provided an exemption for the growth and consumption of marihuana.166 Mr. Kubby decided it would be too difficult to find someone who could rent him a home under these circumstances, yet advanced little evidence other than his testimony, that this was so. He decided it would be an unnecessary violation of his civil rights to have a probation officer possessed with such power, for three years, yet advanced no concrete evidence of a problem. Prosecutor Christopher Cattran noted there is recourse for a defendant who alleges a probation officer is improperly using the search clause.167\n[183] In summary, Mr. Kubby has not rebutted the onus upon him to establish that his state is not able to protect him from rogue probation officers or law enforcement acting beyond the scope of their power. In addition, he has not established the state as a whole, is in a situation of complete breakdown. I am satisfied the US government is able to protect Mr. Kubby from persecution, if he were to actually face persecutory acts in the US.\nCLAIM PURSUANT TO IRPA Section 97\n(a) Definition and Burden of Proof\n[184] As stated above, section 97 of the IRPA168 requires a person claiming refugee protection to establish that they face a risk to their life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, in their country of origin. This risk is to be assessed using the standard of \"serious possibility.\"169 Section 97 also provides protection to individuals who establish there are good grounds to believe they will be tortured within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture.170\n(b) Nature of Mr. Kubby's Risk to Life Claim\n[185] Mr. Kubby alleges he will be incarcerated in a prison if he returns to the US. Mr. Kubby alleges further that he will be denied his drug of choice, cannabis, if incarcerated, and that he will die as a result of the denial of cannabis. I find that this is speculation on his part.\n[186] Governor Davis' Bill 420 previously mentioned, contains section 11362.785(c) that provides as follows:\nNothing in this article shall prohibit a jail, correctional facility, or other penal institution in which prisoners reside or persons under arrest are detained, from permitting a prisoner ... to use marijuana for medical purposes under circumstances that will not endanger the health and safety of other prisoners or the security of the facility.171\n[187] There is insufficient evidence that Mr. Kubby would not be afforded appropriate medical attention, should he need it, while serving his sentence in a state prison. The evidence he proffered of what transpired while he was briefly detained when he was initially charged with drug offences, is inconclusive. Mr. Kubby alleges he will go into adrenal failure, his blood pressure would become elevated, and he could have a stroke or heart attack, if left unattended. Dr. Connors agrees with Mr. Kubby's description of what is likely to happen, should he be cut off from marihuana.172\n[188] There is insufficient evidence that Mr. Kubby would not be removed from his jail cell and taken immediately to a hospital for treatment if a medical crisis occurred. We have no evidence that Mr. Kubby would not be permitted to treat himself in a US hospital, with marihuana for medicinal purposes, through the use of a vaporiser, for example.\n[189] In fact, we have evidence to the contrary, from Angel McCleary Raich. Ms. Raich testified173 she was permitted to use a vaporiser while in hospital, in order to medicate with marihuana. Mr. Kubby has not established his hospital placement if required, would result in different treatment. Dr. Connors was asked whether he had ever treated a patient with adrenal cancer who was incarcerated. He replied:\nyou need to understand that his is a very rare problem, and the chance that an incarcerated prisoner would happen to have this condition has to be astronomically small.174\n[190] Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that if the state correctional authorities are presented with a medical history, treatment for Mr. Kubby's illness would factor in the rarity of his condition and authorities may conclude that permitting Mr. Kubby to ingest cannabis or marinol175 while in jail, would not set a dangerous precedent for future patients in similar situations, because his illness is so rare. That fact alone suggests a unique handling of Mr. Kubby's case is likely. Mr. Kubby was asked if he had ever used marinol and he said he had not and would not, because he feared side-effects. Marinol is a substance used in place of cannabis where smoking is not permitted, as it can be ingested orally.176\n[191] The evidence tendered by Mr. Kubby to establish a failure of the justice and medical systems in the US that would amount to risk of harm to him and his family, has been described by Mr. Kubby. He has described undergoing surveillance, the execution of a search warrant, threats of federal charges that have never materialised, uncertainty that he would be permitted to ingest marihuana in a federal or state prison, the refusal to extend the one hour he was permitted to be outside his home while serving his house arrest sentence, the refusal to revoke the \"searchable probation\" clause, the threat to involve state child welfare authorities should he smoke marihuana in front of his children, and the refusal to drop all criminal charges against him. In my opinion, all of the allegations Mr. Kubby presents are subject to the \"self-correcting mechanisms\" described by Mr. Justice MacGuigan in Satiacum. They do not, even cumulatively, lead me to conclude Mr. Kubby is a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a risk to his life.\n[192] Mr. Kubby alleges that he cannot serve his 120-day prison sentence because he will die once cut off from marihuana. The medical evidence does not establish that he would (a) die if cut off from marihuana, or (b) be denied appropriate medical care while in a US correctional facility if he suffered an acute medical crisis as a result of not ingesting cannabis.\n[193] He asked Judge Cosgrove in the proceedings on April 6, 2001 if the court would \"pay particular attention to my arguments regarding my life and death medical necessity for marijuana if I am jailed\" to which the Judge replied: \"I am sure if you are jailed, that situation can be taken care of one way or another.\"177 He also went on to consider the 8th Amendment and whether it would amount to cruel and unusual punishment and held: \"I have considered it. It's certainly not unusual treatment if you are treated like any other person similarly situated. That's not cruel and unusual.\"178\n[194] Many high-profile prisoners are protected during the whole of their terms of imprisonment. Protection includes ensuring the personal safety of the prisoner and that person's physical and mental well-being. I am not persuaded that the US correctional system will be unable or unwilling to ensure Mr. Kubby survives his penal incarceration, if indeed he is incarcerated in a prison, a fact that has not been established. I think it is fair to say that either the Department of Corrections (for state prisoners) or the Bureau of Prisons (for federal prisoners) are capable of taking care of Mr. Kubby's special needs, if he is in danger while in prison. They are charged with the duty to protect Mr. Kubby while he is in one of their institutions. Mr. Kubby has not established that they would fail to do so in his case.\n[195] A document filed by Mr. Kubby discusses this issue.179 This paper, written by John Gordiner, a senior assistant Attorney General for the state of California states:\n... County and state operated correctional facilities are generally deemed to be responsible for insuring that persons committed to custody receive proper and necessary medical care. This duty carries with it the right to independently evaluate the medical condition of an inmate to determine the appropriate treatment.\nThus, it would appear that a physician working for the facility may independently determine whether any inmate has the right to use marijuana as medicine. [footnote: Mere disagreements between treating physicians, or between an inmate and his treating physician, about the kind of medical care that is adequate or necessary in his case fails to state a constitutional violation and thus, a cause of action under paragraph 1983 of the Federal Civil Rights Act. (see Sanchez v. Vild, 897 F. 2d 240, 242 (9th Circ. 1989); Franklin v. Oregon, 662 F.2d 1337, 1344 (9th Circ. 1981)].\n[196]\nThe decision about inmates use of cannabis is left to the attending physician at the prison.\nWhile there are concerns about inmates in the state's jails and prisons claiming illness and the need for marijuana, the physician working at the facility must independently determine whether an inmate should be provided marijuana, consistent with facility security policies.180\n[197] I infer from this that the provision of cannabis to a prisoner might be available in certain circumstances, such as those presented by Mr. Kubby.\n[198] Notwithstanding Mr. Kubby's assertions he will not be provided cannabis in jail, we have further evidence to the contrary, in the testimony of Judge Gray:\nI can tell you there is a constitutional right to medical treatment if you are in custody of the Marshall's office...that is why it gets too expensive to keep older people in prison.181\n[199] Judge Gray goes on to say that the Preamble to the US Constitution confirms the government's obligation to promote the general welfare.182\n[200] In addition, there was the evidence of William Panzer who testified that Mr. Kubby would be permitted to serve his time in a prison hospital if it was necessary for his health, and that there is a fundamental right to receive medical treatment without unreasonable interference from the government. He described this as \"substantive due process.\"183 He described what happens in situations involving prisoners with AIDS, those on heart-lung machines, or in need of dialysis. In his opinion, there is a fundamental right under the Constitution to get access to medical care, but questioned whether it would be appropriate or adequate care.184\n[201] Both Judge Gray and Mr. Panzer, by virture of their roles in the US justice system, have knowledge of its correctional system. This evidence, given objectively, as officers of the court, suggests a very different scenario than that described by Mr. Kubby.\n[202] Finally, Mr. Satterberg testified there are national corrections standards for prisoners who are in need of medical care and are wards of the state. It was his evidence that there would be liability to the county for its failure to provide proper medical care.185\n[203] In addition, Mr. Cattran's testimony indicates that once Mr. Kubby serves his time on the pending convictions, there are no other charges he will face, and the state of California has no intention of reviving the charges upon which Mr. Kubby has been tried.186\n[204] The Common Law recognises the difference between \"reasonable inference\" on the facts in evidence, and \"pure conjecture.\" It would be pure conjecture on my part to accept that correctional officials would ignore an acute medical crisis while Mr. Kubby is under their care, for political or other reasons, as he serves his sentence. The words of Lord Macmillan are instructive:\nThe dividing line between conjecture and inference is often a very difficult one to draw. A conjecture may be plausible but it is of no legal value, for its essence is that it is a mere guess. An inference in the legal sense, on the other hand, is a deduction from the evidence, and if it is a reasonable deduction it may have the validity of legal proof. The attribution of an occurrence to a cause is, I take it, always a matter of inference.187\n[205] Mr. Kubby's case is unique, in that no other person has advanced a similar claim before the Immigration and Refugee Board and in that Dr. Connors has testified his situation is extremely rare. In fact, William Panzer testified that he has no knowledge of any case where an accused had a \"life and death necessity\" for marihuana as Mr. Kubby alleges to have. Mr. Kubby alleges that by virtue of his unique medical condition, any period of incarceration would endanger his life. However, on both occasions that Mr. Kubby was incarcerated, he was afforded medical attention immediately upon complaining of a medical crisis. No witness was able to say that Mr. Kubby would not obtain the medical treatment he required if incarcerated.\n[206] There are facts to the contrary: (1) a penitentiary system that has the ability to protects its inmates, (2) a Probation Order permitting him to serve his sentence in his home; (3) Dr. Connors ability to speak authoritatively on Mr. Kubby's behalf before this Board, and presumably if he needed a medical opinion in the US; (4) the notoriety of Mr. Kubby's public assertion that he will die without marihuana. These facts could permit an inference that the claimant's life would not be in danger if imprisoned. There are no facts on the record that would found the opposing inference - that Mr. Kubby would die if incarcerated in a US prison. On that side there is only conjecture.\n(c) Lawful Sanctions\n[207] In analysing Mr. Kubby's risk to life and risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, above, I have found he has not established such a risk. I have found that what Mr. Kubby alleges he risks is criminal prosecution pursuant to lawful sanctions. Mr. Kubby must establish that the risk to his life is inherent and incidental to lawful sanctions that have been imposed in disregard of international standards.\n[208] Mr. Kubby cannot be sent to jail other than through the imposition of lawful sanctions. The United States is a signatory to international treaties, some of which are intended to control international and domestic trafficking in controlled substances. The CUA is in place in part to fulfill the US obligation under these treaties. Canada's apparently more flexible laws on marihuana for medical use are the first in the world.188 Possession (at least for the moment) and distribution of marihuana remains illegal in Canada. The Health Canada medical exemption afforded to Mr. Kubby provides amounts permissible to possess and grow depending on individual need.189\n[209] The Canadian Medical Association (like its US counterpart), opposes the medical exemption because there is insufficient empirical scientific research available to permit doctors to properly prescribe dosage. While there is currently a source of the drug legally available through Health Canada, many medical doctors are reluctant to have marihuana in their offices due to the high potential for abuse.190 There is no evidence before the panel that US marihuana laws and sanctions arising from them are imposed in disregard of international standards.\n[210] I find there is insufficient evidence to conclude Mr. Kubby's medical condition would be ignored if he were sentenced to a penal institution. He has therefore not established that he is a person in need in protection.\n[211] The analysis with respect to state protection applies to the analysis of his claim under section 97 as well.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n[212] We heard from witnesses from other jurisdictions, notably from Washington State (Mr. Satterberg) and from Oregon (Ms. Leverette) about their medical marihuana drug policies. Mr. Kubby has not established he has a well founded fear of persecution or a risk under IRPA section 97, in California, in that his subjective fear and risk to his life, have not been objectively established, as discussed above. Accordingly, it is not necessary to analyse whether he has an Internal Flight Alternative to another part of the United States.\nCLAIMS OF MICHELE KUBBY AND THE MINOR CLAIMANTS\n[213] Ms. Kubby has made her claim on the basis of her husband's. She claims to be at risk to her life independently of her husband. She testified that she suffers from irritable bowel syndrome and ingests marihuana as her drug of choice. While she is in possession of a medical recommendation to use marihuana in the US, she did not provide this to the Board. I accept that she was granted this recommendation in California. She concedes that hers is not a medical necessity need for marihuana and that other drugs might help her with her medical problem, though not as well as marihuana does. She also conceded that many doctors do not believe her illness warrants a recommendation that she use marihuana for medical purposes.191\n[214] Ms. Kubby testified that she could use medical marihuana in the US but she does not possess a doctor's recommendation or a Health Canada exemption, in Canada. In my opinion, Ms. Kubby is in a worse position vis \u00e0 vis her use of medical marihuana in Canada, where she is not permitted to use it, than she is in the US, where she is permitted to use cannabis.\n[215] While she alleges that the quality of her life is affected when she does not use cannabis, she conceded that there is not a risk to her personally if she is denied its use.\n[216] Her risk is based upon the fact, in part, that she was arrested along with her husband because the marihuana was grown at their residence. She fears she will be charged with other crimes related to assisting her husband because she tends their marihuana garden. She fears charges of cultivation, and perhaps conspiracy. She alleges that she will be prosecuted by federal authorities for her work on Pot TV and her reporting on US drug policies. She also fears what would happen to her and their children if Mr Kubby had to return to the US.192 I note that Ms. Kubby was acquitted of all charges she was accused of along with Mr. Kubby and there are no outstanding charges against Ms. Kubby at present. Ms. Kubby alleges that she fears \"prosecution.\"193\n[217] The Minister on the other hand submits that Ms. Kubby has not shown that there is a serious possibility she would be persecuted if she were to return to the US with or without her husband. Ms. Kubby did not file any evidence to suggest that she is of interest to law enforcement officials in the US, either federally or in the state of California, or any other state.\n[218] In addition, Ms. Kubby concedes that her use of marihuana for irritable bowel syndrome is a choice for her and not a medical necessity. She has not advanced any evidence of a risk to her life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if she returns to the US. She has alleged that she fears her children will be taken from her if she returns to the US, however, she has not persuaded me that this is a real possibility in the circumstances.\nSUMMARY\n[219] What Mr. Kubby alleges does not amount to persecution. He was prosecuted for a breach of a law of general application. His prosecution ultimately resulted in all marihuana charges being dealt with, none by conviction.\n[220] Mr. Kubby likens his situation to that of a diabetic. He asserts that the state would never deprive a diabetic of their insulin and he should not be denied life-saving marihuana. As I have said, there is a clear distinction between insulin, which has been approved by the American Medical Association, and cannabis, which has not. Not only has cannabis use not been approved, it has been denounced in some quarters and described as \"snake oil\" by others. I do not agree. It is clear from the evidence advanced in this case, that marihuana is helping control Mr. Kubby's cancer symptoms. However, more research is needed to draw a medical connection between Mr. Kubby's longevity with a terminal illness, and his ingestion of marihuana as the cause of this longevity.194\n[221] As the sentencing judge said:\nThis case started off as a marijuana case. It's not a marijuana case today. It went through a trial and the jury essentially decided that the issue of marijuana...[is] out of the picture. This is a case regarding possession of two illegal substances, mushrooms and peyote buttons. Much of this argument has revolved around marihuana. That's not the issue. 195\n[222] Mr. Kubby is still trying to make this a case about the denial of his right to cultivate and possess marihuana. That is not what this refugee case is about. He argues that a medical marihuana patient should be protected from prosecution. What he has demonstrated is that in fact, they are.\n[223] Despite Mr. Kubby's evidence that he has a well founded fear of persecution in the United States, it is important to note that as a medical marihuana patient with a recommendation to use marihuana in California, Mr. Kubby has limited immunity from prosecution.\n[224] The state of California in Proposition 215 and later under the CUA, has chosen not to decriminalise the use and possession of medical marihuana for patients. Instead, the decision was made to permit sick and dying Californians to possess and cultivate marihuana so long as its conditions are satisfied-and have made it no more criminal than possession and acquisition of any prescription drug with a physician's prescription.196\n[225] The burden (at least for the present) is on the patient to satisfy law enforcement of a medical need and a supply of the medicine to address that need. Anything beyond this, would be litigated in a court for a judge to decide. This is what Californians decided would be a fair process in order to provide marihuana for patients and also to deal with the high potential for abuse. It is not for the Immigration and Refugee Board to look behind this process decided by the public and the courts in California.\n[226] Chief Justice Ronald M. George wrote for the Court:\nIn light of its language and purpose, [Proposition 215] reasonably must be interpreted to grant a defendant limited immunity from prosecution, which not only allows a defendant to raise his or her status as a qualified patient or primary caregiver as a defense at trial, but also permits a defendant to raise such status by moving to set aside an indictment or information prior to trial on the ground of the absence of reasonable or probable cause to believe that he or she is guilty.197\n[227] Mr. Kubby has the option open to him when he returns to the US to raise the defence at the time of any future investigation, that he is a qualified patient, growing an amount as required by him. If charged he may yet again raise the medical necessity defence in a pre-trial motion, or at trial. At each step, he is entitled to full answer and defence. His preferred process would be for someone to advise him how much he can safely grow and then he would grow that amount, thereby being guaranteed not to be prosecuted. Perhaps this would be the best approach. Certainly it is the approach that Canada has adopted. But it is not the only approach and governments are entitled to choose from amongst a variety of approaches in order to deal with this difficult issue. There are fifty-two states in the US - some, like Washington and California, have very liberal and clear medical marihuana laws. Mr. Kubby is free to choose to live in whichever state he feels best meets his medical needs.\n[228] Mr. Kubby does not fear persecution in the US. Moreover, he has not rebutted the presumption that the state is capable of protecting him, for the reasons given above.\n[229] In addition, I find that Mr. Kubby is not at risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a risk to his life. He asserts he is at risk of being jailed and will die if imprisoned because he will be cut off from cannabis. He has failed to demonstrate this is even remotely likely. The scope of section 97(1)(b) is very narrow. The provisions will benefit mainly those who face a risk which is not generalised.\n[230] Moreover, Mr. Kubby's risk is incidental to lawful sanctions and a claimant is not a person in need of protection if the risk faced is inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions. Lawful sanctions however, cannot be imposed in disregard of accepted international standards. I have carefully analysed his claim and find that the laws in the United States that are relevant to Mr. Kubby's claim do not offend international norms and as such, he has not established there is a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\n[231] Finally, I have adjudicated this claim on the basis of domestic law, that is, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, but I have done so with the understanding that there is a common law presumption that Canada's laws have been enacted with the intention of giving force to Canada's international obligations. Accordingly, I have considered domestic law such as Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which states that everyone has the right to life, liberty and the security of the person.198 I have also considered the Canadian Bill of Rights, which contains similar provisions dealing with the fundamental human right of protection of the person,199 and which state that no law of Canada shall be construed or applied so as to impose or authorise the imposition of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. I have also considered international instruments such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which provides that no one shall be subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment;200 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) which discusses cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.201\n[232] I do not take these internationally protected rights lightly. However, I am not satisfied that what Mr. Kubby describes amounts to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or that if it does, his state is unwilling or unable to protect him from such a risk. Accordingly, I am satisfied that what Mr. Kubby describes is not a risk of harm that is envisioned by the IRPA or the international instruments.\n[233] Finally, I have considered whether there is a danger that Mr. Kubby will be tortured if he returns to the US. In section 97(1)(a) \"Torture\" has been described as:\n... any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.202\n[234] What Mr. Kubby alleges does not fit this definition. He is arguing he will be denied medication, not that he would be tortured while incarcerated to extract information by a state agent or with the acquiescence of the state. This is simply not what was envisioned when the Convention Against Torture was enacted. I find further, that the lawful sanctions exception applies here as well.\n[235] In summary, Mr. Kubby has not established he has either a well founded fear of persecution under section 96 (IRPA), or a risk to his life under section 97 (IRPA).\nDETERMINATION\n[236] I find that Steven Wynn KUBBY is not a Convention refugee as he does not have a well founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in the United States. I also find that the claimant is not a person in need of protection in that his removal to the United States would not subject him personally to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or\npunishment, and in that there are no substantial grounds to believe that his removal to the United States will subject him personally to a danger of torture. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the claim for refugee protection of Steven Wynn KUBBY is hereby rejected.\n[237] There is no reasonable basis upon which to conclude Ms. Kubby faces a reasonable chance of persecution for a Convention reason should she return to the US. Likewise, she has not advanced any evidence of a risk to her life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture.\n[238] Because her husband's claim for refugee protection has been dismissed, to the extent her claim is dependent upon his, her claim too must fail. She has not established a well founded fear of persecution on the basis of her membership in Mr Kubby's family. Nor has she established any evidence she would suffer harm for any other reason, independent of his claim.\n[239] Ms. Kubby alleges her children might be taken away from her because of her husband's use of marihuana.203 Brooke was not taken into protective custody by state child welfare authorities at the time the Kubbys were arrested in 1999, even though there was an allegation of child abuse contained in the anonymous letter that started the investigation.204 There is no independent evidence of persecution of the children, nor any evidence of a risk of harm, and Ms. Kubby confirmed that they have not been threatened. The claims of the children must fail for the same reason.\n[240] I find that Ms. Kubby and her daughters are not Convention refugees as they do not have a well founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in the United States. I also find that these three claimants are not persons in need of protection in that their removal to the United States would not subject any of them personally to a risk to their lives or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, and in that there are no substantial grounds to believe that\ntheir removal to the United States will subject them personally to a danger of torture. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, I conclude that Ms. Kubby and her two daughters are not Convention refugees and they are not persons in need of protection. I therefore reject their claims.\n[241] Accordingly, the claims for refugee protection of Michele Renee KUBBY, Brooke Kona KUBBY, and Crystal Bay KUBBY are hereby rejected.\n\"Paulah Dauns\"\nPaulah Dauns\nNovember 17, 2003\nDate\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - POLITICAL OPINION - PARTICULAR SOCIAL GROUP - MEDICAL EVIDENCE - MEDICAL TREATMENT - PERSECUTION - PROSECUTION - LAW OF GENERAL APPLICATION - PERSON IN NEED OF PROTECTION - RISK TO LIFE - RISK OF CRUEL AND UNUSUAL TREATMENT - RISK OF CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT - GENERALIZED RISK - NOT FACED GENERALLY BY OTHER INDIVIDUALS - LAWFUL SANCTIONS - ACCEPTED INTERNATIONAL STANDARD - STATE PROTECTION - TORTURE - CONVENTION AGAINST TORTURE - IMPRISONMENT - STATUTORY INTERPRETATION - IMMIGRATIONS AND REFUGEE PROTECTION ACT - CONSTITUTIONAL LAW - CANADIAN CHARTER OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS - CANADIAN BILL OF RIGHTS - INTERNATIONAL LAW - INTERNATIONAL INSTRUMENTS - PUBLIC HEARING - MALE - FEMALE - NEGATIVE - USA\n1 Exhibit 3.1.\n2 Exhibits 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4.\n3 Section 96 of Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n4 Section 97 of Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n5 Section 20 RPD Rules SOR\/2002-228 11 June 2002.\n20.

The trial judge ruled that because possession of peyote was a \"wobbler\" (the US equivalent of a \"hybrid offence\") and the more serious of the two crimes -possession of mescaline should be reduced to a misdemeanour as well as the peyote charge. The Court of Appeal held that the Rules of statutory interpretation do not permit a Court to rewrite section 11350 and ignore its plain language, which unambiguously makes possession of mescaline a felony. The judgment was modified to reflect that the conviction is a felony. Except as modified, the judgment was affirmed.\n35 Exhibit 21, page 68.

Proposition 36 - Substance Abuse and Crime Prevention Act of 2000 was passed by the electorate on November 7, 2000, and regulates how the California criminal justice system will deal with substance abusers who violate the criminal laws of California. The statutes enacted by Proposition 36 mandate probation and drug treatment for defendants convicted of a \"non-violent drug possession offence.\" Incarceration is prohibited as a condition of probation when the defendant is first sentenced. Mr. Kubby had hoped the bar against incarceration would apply in his case. It did not apply to Mr. Kubby because it only applied to those who committed an offence after July 1, 2001. Since Mr. Kubby was charged in 1999, he was not entitled to sentencing under Proposition 36 provisions. Any new convictions would be subject to these provisions.\n43 Evidence of Michele Renee Kubby, Transcript, March 6, 2003, page 90, lines 7 - 20.

He makes a claim for refugee protection based upon the doctrine of \"compelling reasons\" arising out of the persecution he faced in the former East Germany between 1963 and 1985. His son, XXXXXXXXXXXX, born in 1970 bases his refugee claim on his father's narrative. At the hearing, counsel for XXXXXXXXXXXX advised the Board that there was no claim being advanced by Mr. XXXXX junior. In fact, after the mid-hearing break, XXXXXXXXXXXX did not return to the hearing.\nAt the end of the hearing counsel agreed to forward written submissions on the issue of compelling reasons by March 13, 2003 and did so on March 12, 2003.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe following is a synopsis of the claimant's1 story taken from his Personal Information Form (PIF)2 and supplemented by the evidence at the hearing.\nThe claimant was born in Dresden, East Germany on XXXXX, 1946. He remained a citizen of East Germany until stripped of his citizenship in 1985. At that point he became a citizen of West Germany.\nThe claimant's claim for refugee status is based upon his experiences in East Germany. Specifically, he attempted to escape from East Germany for the first time in 1963. He was apprehended and sentenced to eight months in jail of which five were spent in solitary confinement. Occasionally prison guards hit him. After release he had to report regularly to authorities and was treated, he said, like a criminal. In 1972, 1974, 1976, and 1977 the claimant made applications to leave East Germany. They were refused and he was told that if he made another he would be jailed. In 1978 the claimant again attempted to escape. Once again he was apprehended. He spent ten months in jail. He was treated badly and made to do menial jobs. He said that he was under great psychological pressure as he was placed amongst hardened criminals.\nIn 1980 the claimant attempted to escape with his foster son. They were caught. The claimant was imprisoned for 22 months. The prison guards did not abuse him but he stated that he considered suicide.\nIn 1984 the claimant again attempted unsuccessfully to escape. He was sentenced to 34 months in one of East Germany's worst jails - Bautzen, known as the \"Yellow Misery.\" He described his psychological condition as \"terrible.\" After serving three quarters of his sentence he was released and sent to West Germany - ironically the very thing he had been unsuccessfully attempting to achieve. The West German authorities paid him compensation for the time he spent in jail in East Germany as a political prisoner and granted him citizenship.\nIn 1987 the claimant came to Canada where he remained until mid-1990. The claimant believes that he initiated a refugee claim but has no documents to establish this.\nIn 1990 when the claimant heard about the fall of East Germany he decided to return. He stated that he wanted to see his family and to sell some inherited property and then return to Canada. However, the process of reclamation took far longer than he expected. In fact it took until May 1998 before he received 13, 000 marks for property he stated was worth 2.5 million marks. He lived in Dresden from 1990 until 1996 when he and two of his sons moved to Bavaria.\nAt this point he returned to Canada with his son XXXXX. He believed that his refugee application was in process. However, when he went to complain about not being paid at his work it was discovered that he had been in Canada illegally and that there was no ongoing refugee application.\nThe claimant described his reason for not wanting to return to Germany as follows:\nI do not want to live in Germany any more because I am always reminded of my past. In the time I was living in Germany in the 1990's, I was often depressed and many times I would get nervous attacks. I relived the events from my past. Even when people recognised me on the street, I had the feeling that my past was catching up with me. It is too difficult for me to live in Germany because of my memories.\nDETERMINATION\nI find that the claimants are not Convention refugees, as neither has a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in Germany. I also find that the claimants are not persons in need of protection in that their removal to Germany would not subject them personally to a risk to their lives or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, and in that there are no substantial grounds to believe that their removal to Germany will subject them personally to a danger of torture. In arriving at this determination the panel has considered all the evidence submitted, the testimony at the hearing, and counsel's submissions. My reasons follow.\nANALYSIS\nThe claimants' identities as nationals of Germany are established by the claimant's testimony and the supporting documentation filed.\nCredibility\nThe claimant provided documents to establish that he was born in East Germany, that he had been imprisoned in East Germany and that he had had his citizenship revoked by East Germany. The claimant spoke at length about his experiences in East Germany. There were many opportunities where he might have exaggerated his story but he did not, even though embellishment might have aided his story. He spoke simply, though eloquently, about what he had experienced.\nPersecution\nWith respect to XXXXXXXXXXXX no claim of persecution, risk to life, risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment nor risk of torture is alleged and no evidence provided that could found such a claim.\nWith respect to XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX he claims that the experiences he suffered in East Germany amounted to persecution and although he would face no future persecution if he returned to Germany, these past experiences constitute \"compelling treasons\" for the Board to grant him protection.\nCompelling Reasons\nSection 108 (1) (e) of the IRPA states:\n(1) A claim for refugee protection shall be rejected, and a person is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, in any of the following circumstances...\n(e) the reasons for which the person sought refugee protection have ceased to exist.\nSubsection (4) of section 108 states:\n(4) Paragraph (1) (e) does not apply to a person who establishes that there are compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution, torture, treatment or punishment for refusing to avail themselves of the protection of the country which they left, or outside of which they remained, due to such previous persecution, torture, treatment or punishment.\nTherefore, three things must be established. Firstly, the treatment suffered by the claimant in the past must amount to persecution, torture, or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. Secondly, the reasons to fear the persecution, torture, cruel and unusual treatment or punishment have ceased to exist. Thirdly, the degree of persecution torture, or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment suffered must be such that it provides compelling reasons not to return the claimant.\nWas There Persecution?\nThe panel finds that the continual imprisonment suffered by the claimant while in East Germany for simply wishing to exit his country constituted persecution. The persecution was clearly based upon his political opinion - namely that he so disagreed with the state that he tried in several manners over twenty years to escape the country.\nHave the Reasons to Fear Persecution Ceased to Exist?\nThe claimant became a citizen of West Germany in 1985. East Germany ceased to exist in 1990. The claimant has suffered no persecution, torture, or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in West Germany. Nor is there any prospect that if he returned to Germany he would face the same. Consequently the second requirement has been met.\nAre There Compelling Reasons not to Return the Claimant to Germany?\nAs noted above the statute requires that the claimant must establish \"compelling reasons\" not to return the claimant. When dealing with the nature of the persecution that might ground compelling reasons the UNHCR Handbook uses the term \"atrocious\" when it states at paragraph 136:\nIt is frequently recognized that a person who--or whose family--has suffered under atrocious forms of persecution should not be expected to repatriate. Even though there may have been a change of regime in his country, this may not always produce a complete change in the attitude of the population nor, in view of his past experiences, in the mind of the refugee.\nAlthough the courts have not interpreted this section 108 (4) of Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), the equivalent section in the old Immigration Act (section 2 (3)) has received considerable attention from the courts. The point of departure in any analysis of compelling reasons is the case of Obstoj.3 In that case Mr. Justice Hugessen stated:\nOn any reading of subsection 2(3) it must extend to anyone who has been recognized as a refugee at any time, even long after the date of the Convention. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that it should also be read as requiring Canadian authorities to give recognition of refugee status on humanitarian grounds to this special and limited category of persons, i.e. those who have suffered such appalling persecution that their experience alone is a compelling reason not to return them, even though they may no longer have any reason to fear further persecution. ... The exceptional circumstances envisaged by subsection 2(3) must surely apply to only a tiny minority of present day claimants.4\nIn Shahid,5 Mr. Justice Noel stated:\nIt seems clear, having regard to Obstoj and Hassan, supra, that the Board erred in construing s. 2(3) as requiring ongoing fear of persecution. The Board, once it embarked upon the assessment of the applicant's claim under s. 2(3), had the duty to consider the level of atrocity of the acts inflicted upon the applicant, the repercussions upon his physical and mental state, and determine whether this experience alone constituted a compelling reason not to return him to his country of origin.\nIn Elemah6 the court commented on the position of the court in Obstoj:\nThe Court, in Obstoj, supra, did not establish a test which necessitates that the persecution reach a level to qualify it as \"atrocious\" and \"appalling\". Rather, the Board must thoroughly consider all the documentary and oral evidence, including the nature of the incidents of torture and the medical reports provided by the parties in order to assess, as is stated in the legislation, if there are \"compelling reasons\" not to return him.\nIt seems clear from the case law that it is the duty of the Board to closely examine what persecution, torture or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment the claimant suffered in order to establish whether that constituted \"compelling reasons.\" That is the focus. Whether the treatment accorded would be described as \"atrocious\" or \"appalling\" is not the issue - it is whether it is so offensive as to provide reason for not expecting the person to be returned.\nAre There compelling Reasons?\nDegree of Persecution\nThe claimant was quite candid about what he suffered while in East Germany. Essentially what he suffered occurred during his time in prison. He suffered a couple of hits by guards but nothing worse. He was asked by the panel to describe his worst day in prison; he recounted a time when a prisoner in a jail went after him with a steel pole. The guards did nothing. However, Mr. XXXXX defended himself with another steel pole and that was the end of the matter. He complained to the guards about the incident but he stated that they did not see it as significant. He was placed in solitary confinement on more than one occasion. He was forced to clean toilets with his bare hands, which he considered demeaning.\nCounsel in his submissions dated March 12, 2003 stated that the most serious harm suffered by the claimant was psychological. He stated:\nTaking his last imprisonment as an example: at the beginning of the imprisonment he was in solitary confinement for 5 or 6 months, during which time he was interrogated in sessions which could be lengthy and take place several times in a single day. Even beyond these initial interrogations, the psychological pressure on the claimant was constant and was aimed at making the claimant conform to the communist regime. The psychological pressure sought to bring about a fundamental change in the claimant's personality.\nUpon release from prison he stated that he had flashbacks, bad dreams and felt terrible. The claimant was asked whether he ever sough medical or psychological assistance for his depression and anxiety. He replied that he had once done so while in Dresden, Germany and he had been prescribed sleeping pills. However, he has never sought assistance in Germany at any other time nor has he since coming to Canada although he states that he still suffers some sleeplessness. Asked why not he referred to \"house medicine\" - a glass of vodka.\nThe panel has considered the cases submitted by counsel and concluded that they are not apposite with respect to the case at hand. In Kulla7 there was a psychological report submitted to the Board. The Board, however, disregarded it and the case was referred back to the Board for re-determination. Here, there is no such report although the issue was canvassed with the claimant as noted above.\nIn Jiminez8 an El Salvadoran man was \"beaten, burned, raped, shot and left for dead\". Nothing equivalent to this happened to Mr. XXXXX. The case of Velasquez9 was not decided on compelling reasons and, at any rate, had to do with whether a person could claim compelling reasons when that person only witnessed the persecution of another. In the case at hand Mr. XXXXX suffered the persecution directly.\nThe panel finds that the experience Mr. XXXXX had while in East Germany while regrettable is not so severe that it would rise to the level of compelling reasons such that he should not be returned to Germany.\nReturn to Germany\nThe panel notes that the claimant was released to West Germany on XXXXX, 1985. He departed for Canada sometime in 1987 according to his PIF but 1986 according to his testimony. He returned to Germany in 1990 for two reasons. Firstly, he wanted to see his family - former wife and children - and secondly, he wanted to deal with his inherited property. While back in Germany he worked. The panel finds that the fact that the claimant could and did remain in West Germany for a year or two after he left East Germany and for approximately eight years in the 90's is an indication that there are not compelling reasons not to return him to Germany.\nTo quote the words of Mr. Justice Rothstein in Hassan:10\nWhile many refugee claimants might consider the persecution they have suffered to fit within the scope of subsection 2(3), it must be remembered that the nature of all persecution, by definition, involves death, physical harm or other penalties. Subsection 2(3), as it has been interpreted, only applies to extraordinary cases in which the persecution is relatively so exceptional, that even in the wake of changed circumstances, it would be wrong to return refugee claimants.\nIn the panel's view while what Mr. XXXXX suffered in East Germany would constitute persecution his case is not one where what he has suffered in so exceptional that it would be wrong to return him to Germany.\nCONCLUSION\nThe panel is of the opinion that there is not more than a mere possibility that should the claimants be returned to Germany they would face persecution or be at risk of torture or risk of life or at risk of being subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. As well section 108(4) is not applicable on the facts of this claim.\nFor the foregoing reasons, I conclude that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXX are not Convention refugees and not persons in need of protection and I therefore reject their claims.\n\"Michael A.

The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) and the Refugee Protection Division Rules (RPD Rules) set out the jurisdiction of the RPD to determine such applications, and the considerations to be taken into account.1\nThe initial application for a Change of Location in this matter was received by the Division on or about November 27, 2002. This application was followed by a second application received by the Division on December 5, 2002 before a decision on the earlier application was reached. The application was denied on December 10, 2002. On December 16, 2002 counsel for the claimant requested reasons for the decision. On January 6, 2003, before reasons could be provided by the Division, counsel for the claimant wrote the Division with an application requesting that the Division reconsider the decision to dismiss the original application. The January 6, 2003 application included an affidavit from the claimant. These reasons cover both the original application and the application to reconsider the Division's initial decision. The Refugee Protection Division disposed of the matter without a hearing.\nBackground\nThe history of this claimant's refugee claim is as follows:\nThe claim was referred to the RPD on July 26, 2002. The claimant was detained by Citizenship and Immigration Canada at the time of the referral. On August 22, 2002 Vancouver counsel for the claimant, Mr. Adrian Huzel, Barrister and Solicitor, advised the Division that he represented the claimant. On August 30, 2002 the Division received a handwritten note from the claimant indicating that he agreed to the withdrawal of his counsel in the matter and advising the Division that the claimant was moving to Toronto and \"would apply for a change of venue from there.\" The claimant did not provide an address in Toronto to the Division and abandonment proceedings were commenced. On October 16, 2002 the abandonment proceedings were set aside after the Division received an address for the claimant in Toronto from CIC.\nOn November 15, 2002 the Division sent a Notice to Appear for a Conference on January 9, 2003. At the time the Notice was sent to the claimant, the Division had received neither a Change of Location Application nor the name of new counsel. On November 21, 2002 the Division received a Notification of Change of Address and Notification of Counsel form from the claimant indicating that both the claimant and counsel resided in Toronto. Consequently, the Division sent the NTA to claimant's new counsel.\nOn November 27, 2002 the claimant forwarded an application to change the location of the proceeding to Toronto. The reason provided by the claimant was the following: \"I would like to be represented by counsel named Nkunda I Kabaterian, Barrister & Solicitor, residing in Toronto. So I wish to have the hearing held in that city.\"\nOn December 3, 2002 the Division received a letter from the claimant's new counsel stating that he was not retained in connection with the claimant's refugee claim.\nOn December 5, 2002 the Division received a letter from the claimant's new counsel indicating he had been formally retained.\nCounsel's letter of December 5, 2002 included a new application for change of location. In the new application the claimant states the following in regard to the reasons for the application: \"I am currently residing in Toronto and have obtained legal aid for purposes of retaining counsel in Toronto. I am currently receiving social assistance and cannot afford to travel to Vancouver for the hearing.\"\nOn December 10, 2002 the Division dismissed the claimant's application. On January 7, 2003 the Division received an application to reconsider its decision.\nConsiderations\nIn deciding this application, I have considered the factors set out in RPD Rule 47(4). The record indicates that the claimant took the step of moving to the intended venue without having advised the Division of his new address. Indeed, it was the Division, on the eve of abandonment proceedings, that discovered the claimant's new address after consulting with CIC. The Division did not receive a notification of change of address from the claimant until November 21, 2002, nearly three months after he had moved. I find the claimant has been less than diligent in keeping the Division informed of his whereabouts.\nAccording to the claimant's affidavit, he moved to Toronto on XXXXX, 2002 without knowing if his request for a change of location would be granted.\nThe fact that the claimant has retained counsel who resides in Toronto does not, on its own, provide sufficient reason to allow the application. The claimant had counsel in Vancouver who assisted him in preparing and filing his Personal Information Form. There is no indication that the current counsel's connection to the claim is any more substantial than that of the previous counsel.\nIn the accompanying application and affidavit the claimant and his current counsel point out that the claimant is \"required\" to reside in Toronto because of an Order for Release signed by a Member of the Immigration Division. I can find nothing in the Order that indicates that appearing for a hearing in Vancouver would violate the conditions of the Order made by the Immigration Division. The jurisdiction of the Refugee Protection Division to determine applications for change of location in regard to its proceedings is \"sole and exclusive.\" Such jurisdiction is not usurped by decisions of the Immigration Division in regard to the conditions for release of those who have been detained under IRPA.\nCounsel's application lists several grounds for the application which include the information that the claimant's intended destination was Toronto where his brother's friend resides. This information is not contained in either of the two applications sent to the Division by the claimant and I give it little weight. In addition, it is stated in the application that the claimant has found employment in Toronto and would lose his job if he returns to Vancouver. I do not find it plausible that the claimant would lose his job for attending a hearing in Vancouver. While attending his hearing in Vancouver would undoubtedly be inconvenient for the claimant, I do not consider that the claimant would be subjected to undue hardship.\nI find reason to dismiss the application in regard to the potential for delay. The current backlog of cases in the RPD in Toronto indicates that it could take two years or longer for the claimant's hearing to be held. In Vancouver, the claimant's refugee claim is more likely to be heard in less than one year. The record indicates that the claim is hearing ready and could be held in a few weeks. To grant a change of location to Toronto would seriously delay the hearing of this refugee claim.\nIn this instance, the inconvenience to the claimant does not outweigh the interference a change of location would cause with the operations of the Board and the provision of a full and fair hearing.\nThe applications for a change of location to Toronto and the application for the Division to \"reconsider\" its previous decision are dismissed. The hearing of this claimant's refugee claim will take place in Vancouver on a date and at a time to be determined.\n\"Richard Jackson\"\nRichard Jackson\nJanuary 22, 2003\nDate\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - APPLICATION - CHANGE OF VENUE - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION RULES - DELAY - RECONSIDERATION - MALE - DISMISSED\n1 IRPA Section 162(1), RPD Rule 47\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRPD File # \/ No. dossier SPR: _________\n- 4 - RPD File # \/ No. dossier SPR: VA2-02153\nRPD File # \/ No. dossier SPR: VA2-02153\n",

She claims to have a well-founded fear of persecution from her former common law husband.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe following is a synopsis of the claimant's story taken from her Personal Information Form (PIF)1 and supplemented by the evidence at the hearing.\nThe claimant, who is from the Canary Islands, began a common law union with XXXXX XXXXXX XXXXX in 1976 when she was 18 years of age. Through him she had two boys - one born in XXX and another born in XXXX. Although there were some calm periods the relationship between the two was abusive. XXXXX frequently beat and threatened her. He warned her not to go to the police as he had connections.\nIn XXXXX 2001 XXXXX went on a trip for several months. While he was away the claimant fled to Canada with her youngest son. The son returned to Spain during the summer. While here she applied for the live-in caregiver programme but was refused. She did not apply for refugee protection, as she did not know about the possibility. In XXXXX the claimant got married to a Canadian citizen. She separated in XXXXX 2002. In XXXXX 2002 the claimant returned to XXXXX because she missed her sons. She had hoped that XXXXX would not find out. However, he did and he threatened her. He had obtained a gun and threatened to use it on her. Afraid, the claimant returned to Canada on July 7, 2002. She claimed refugee protection on August 2, 2002.\nDETERMINATION\nI find that the claimant is not a Convention refugee, as she does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in Spain. I also find that the claimant is not a person in need of protection in that her removal to Spain would not subject her personally to a risk to her life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, and in that there are no substantial\ngrounds to believe that her removal to Spain will subject her personally to a danger of torture. In arriving at this determination the panel has considered all the evidence submitted, her testimony at the hearing, and counsel's submissions. My reasons follow.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\nThe claimant's identity as a national of Spain is established by her testimony and the supporting documentation filed, namely, a certified copy of her passport.2\nCredibility\nThe panel found the claimant to be essentially a credible witness. She produced a report from Dr. XXXXX,3 which lends support to her story of long standing abuse.\nState Protection\nThe determinative issue raised in this claim is that of state protection. In Ward, the Supreme Court of Canada articulated the \"rationale underlying the international refugee protection regime\" as follows:\nThe international community intended that persecuted individuals be required to approach their home state for protection before the responsibility of other states becomes engaged. For this reason, James Hathaway refers to the refugee scheme as \"surrogate or substitute protection\", activated only upon failure of national protection....4\nThe Supreme Court underlined this point when it stated that:\nAbsent a situation of complete breakdown of state apparatus, such as that recognized in Lebanon in Zalzali, it should be assumed that the state is capable of protecting a claimant.5\nThe Supreme Court held that this presumption might be rebutted where the claimant \"provides\" or \"advances\" \"clear and convincing proof\" or \"clear and convincing confirmation\" of the state's inability to protect.6 Whether a claimant need also have literally approached his or her state for protection to rebut the presumption, the Supreme Court stated that:\n...only in situations in which state protection \"might reasonably have been forthcoming\", will the claimant's failure to approach the state for protection defeat his claim. Put another way, the claimant will not meet the definition of a \"Convention refugee\" where it is objectively unreasonable for the claimant not to have sought the protection of his home authorities; otherwise the claimant need not literally approach the state.7\nThe claimant has the onus of rebutting the presumption that her state is capable of providing protection.\nThe Claimant's Situation\nThe claimant did not approach the police at any point. In her PIF she stated that XXXXX had told her not to,\n\"...because he had friends with the police and if he found out that there was a complaint against him I would never walk the street again. I knew he was capable of carrying out his threats and therefore I did not go to the police.\"8\nIn her testimony she specified that his \"friend\" was the chief police constable for the island. She also mentioned that she had once run away to Madrid but that he had found her. This was not mentioned in her PIF and the panel asked her why it had not been and whether she had sought protection from the police in Madrid. She answered that she thought she had mentioned this in her PIF and that she had not sought police protection in Madrid because he had warned her that it would make it worse for her. The claimant, although aware of women's shelters, did not approach them as she was of the view that they could offer her no assistance and that they were required to report any approach to the police. If this were done XXXXX would find out and she would be especially vulnerable.\nTHE OBJECTIVE SITUATION IN SPAIN\nCounsel, in his submissions, referred to several documents that point out that domestic abuse is a serious problem in Spain and has been so for some time.9\nThe Times states that the Spanish courts do not \"always punish those who raise their hands to their spouses\" (9 Mar. 2000). Terra reported that it was difficult to obtain the proof required to lodge a complaint against an abusive spouse and that in most cases of domestic violence, the alleged aggressor remained in liberty despite the potential risks to the victim (18 May 2000). Concepci\u00f3n Dancausa, Secretary General of Social Affairs, confirmed that proof in domestic violence cases was difficult to present (ibid.). According to Terra, in 82 per cent of the cases, men who mistreat their spouses or partners were not punished and in many cases, victims of domestic violence were killed by their aggressors at the moment they decided to report the violence to the authorities (ibid.).10\nCounsel cited three reports11 in El Pais that refer to killings of women by their domestic partners in 2003. The panel does not doubt the seriousness of the situation. However, the issue is whether Spain is taking serious steps to combat the problem. In the panel's view it is.\nWhile noting that violence against women and particularly spousal abuse is a problem the 2001 DOS Report12 nevertheless notes several serious efforts made by the state to address the problem:\nThe law prohibits rape and spousal abuse. Police received 1,219 reports of rape during the year. In May the Government initiated its second Plan Against Domestic Violence, with a proposed budget of $72 million (13 billion pesetas) over 4 years. The four principal areas outlined in the plan are preventive education; improvements in judicial regulations and practices to protect victims and increase the penalty for abusers; the extension of social services for abused women to all parts of the country; and increased coordination among the agencies and organizations involved in preventing domestic violence.\nDuring the first plan, from 1998 to 2000, the Government sponsored 3 publicity campaigns and distributed over 750,000 educational pamphlets. It trained additional personnel for each of the 54 Civil Guard units that assist battered women and created 43 similar units in the National Police. There are 53 offices that provide legal assistance to victims of domestic violence and approximately 225 shelters for battered women. A 24-hour free national hot line that advises women where to find local assistance or shelter received 260,000 calls in 2000.\nThe Research Directorate has also provided information on steps taken by Spain to address the issue of domestic abuse:13\nIn the context of its 1998-2000 domestic violence plan, the Spanish government established the following protection measures to victims of domestic abuse: 103 information centres, 66 shelters, 54 police units specialized in domestic violence, offices of legal aid in 41 regional courts, and 27 local clinics (The Lancet 26 May 2001). Training in the treatment of domestic violence cases was delivered to over 60,000 health care professionals, social workers, teachers, counsellors, police and lawyers (ibid.). One of the milestones of the plan was to criminalize psychological violence (ibid.). In June 1999, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Work and Social Affairs signed an agreement that would provide immediate legal assistance to victims of domestic violence by allocating 186 million pesetas (CDN$1.5 million) to train staff in matters related to violence against women (Terra 13 June 2000). The funding would improve legal assistance and strengthen the assistance offices for battered women (ibid.). These offices, which are located in judicial buildings, provide psychological and social services to victims, and provide information as to the process involved for lodging complaints with judicial or administrative authorities (ibid.).\nCountry Reports 2000 reported that the 1998-2001 domestic violence plan also made provisions for the criminalization of violating restraining orders (Section 5, 2001). However, the Spanish Federation of Separated and Divorced Women criticized the plan for not making the issuing of restraining orders automatic upon making a complaint of domestic violence; currently, restraining orders are only issued if the aggressor has been found guilty (ibid.)...\nFollowing on the heels of the first domestic violence plan, the Spanish government approved a second plan that would be carried out from 2001 to 2004 (The Lancet 26 May 2001). The second plan will have a budget of US$71 million, which is 63 per cent more than the budget of the first plan, and will be invested in the areas of care and social intervention, prevention, legal aid and research (ibid.). After the plan was announced, Juan Carlos Aparicio, Minister of Work and Social Affairs, stated that the new plan calls for the reform of the Penal Code to ensure that abusive men who are found guilty of domestic violence are denied paternal authority (ibid.).\nThe Website of the Spanish National Police Corps (Cuerpo Nacional de Polic\u00eda de Espa\u00f1a) reports the following on recourse available to victims of domestic violence (2 June 2001).\nAlmost all police officers have information on how to lodge a complaint of domestic violence, on where women's shelters and foster homes are located, and other institutions where women may seek assistance. Most governments, at all levels, provide recourse to victims. There is an emergency hotline managed by the Women's Institute that victims may call for assistance. Victims may lodge complaints and ask about the procedures involved in obtaining a protection court order (orden judicial de protecci\u00f3n) with the police court (Juzgado de Guardia). It is the responsibility of the police court to explain in detail protection measures available to victims, such as preventative custody for the accused aggressor (prisi\u00f3n preventiva), removal order (alejamiento), periodic visits of the accused to the courts, the withdrawal of weapons and police protection (La Opini\u00f3n 30 Apr. 2001). Terra reported that victims also have recourse to a personal push-button alarm (pulsadores de alarma) that, when activated, alerts the local police station (18 May 2000).\nEFFECTIVENESS OF STATE PROTECTION FOR THE CLAIMANT\nThe claimant stated that the police could not offer her effective protection. The court in Ward14 did not deal with the issue of the effectiveness of state protection. The Federal Court of Appeal has dealt with the issue to some extent in two cases, which at first blush appear to be in opposition.\nIn Villafranca,15 which was a case where a policeman from the Philippines fled the country after a communist terrorist guerilla group targeted him, the court stated:\nThe burden of showing that one is not able to avail oneself of the protection of one's own state is not easily satisfied. The test is an objective one and involves the claimant showing either that he is physically prevented from seeking his government's aid (clearly not the case here) or that the government itself is in some way prevented from giving it.\nNo government that makes any claim to democratic values or protection of human rights can guarantee the protection of all of its citizens at all times. Thus, it is not enough for a claimant merely to show that his government has not always been effective at protecting persons in his particular situation. Terrorism in the name of one warped ideology or another is a scourge afflicting many societies today; its victims, however much they may merit our sympathy, do not become convention refugees simply because their governments have been unable to suppress the evil. Where, however, the state is so weak, and its control over all or part of its territory so tenuous as to make it a government in name only, as this Court found in the case of Zalzali v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) a refugee may justly claim to be unable to avail himself of its protection. Situations of civil war, invasion or the total collapse of internal order will normally be required to support a claim of inability. On the other hand, where a state is in effective control of its territory, has military, police and civil authority in place, and makes serious efforts to protect its citizens from terrorist activities, the mere fact that it is not always successful at doing so will not be enough to justify a claim that the victims of terrorism are unable to avail themselves of such protection.16\nHowever, in the later case of Mendivil,17 the Federal Court of Appeal also analysed the issue of the effectiveness of state protection. Mendivil was a case where the claimant, an ex-mayor in Peru, had been targeted by the Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path), and had fled his country after learning that he was a target of the Sendero Luminoso. He told the Board that a former colleague and former mayor of another town had also been assassinated. The court in arriving at the decision to refer the case back to the Board mentioned that the Board had not had the benefit of the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in Ward before arriving at its conclusion. It also pointed out that the Board, in arriving at its negative conclusion, had not referred to the documentary evidence that showed that the Shining Path had successfully assassinated several public figures, nor adequately dealt with the evidence that showed that the state might not have been effectively in control of all of Peru, particularly where the claimant was living in Peru. As the court put it:\nIn their reasons, the Board members alluded to the fact that the claimant was able to live in Lima without \"adverse consequences\" until his departure in 1991. This, in itself, is not conclusive of the matter since, notwithstanding that fact, a claimant may still fear persecution and have good grounds for fearing persecution. They then pursued but gave no clear indication as to the effective portions of the evidence they focused on when they made their finding that the government authorities and agencies \"were making successful efforts to counter-act insurgency and violence in Peru\". While they referred to a reduction in the number of provinces under emergency and noted that the police and not the army was responsible for the security in the capital of Lima where the claimant resided, I still wonder which inferences were drawn which would explain their conclusion. Nor did the Board members explain why the protection this claimant could enjoy as an ordinary person was adequate in the circumstances. The Board members do not appear to have considered the possibility that persons specifically targeted, who may qualify as members of a particular social group, might still have good grounds for fearing persecution when a state is capable of protecting ordinary citizens but incapable of protecting members of that particular social group. In addition, I cannot be sure that the Board members appreciated the facts in their entirety, since they did not refer to the 1992 events. I remain in doubt as to whether the evidence as a whole was considered.18\nIt appears that the court in Mendivil was dissatisfied with the documentary analysis of the Board, particularly because there was evidence indicating that people in the position of the claimant had been successfully targeted and assassinated by the Shining Path.\nIt should be noted that the decision of the court in Mendivil, although subsequent to that of Villafranca, refers and quotes from that case and does not reverse it. I conclude from that the court did not see the cases as arriving at conflicting positions. In Villafranca the claimant was a member of the state - a policeman. In Mendivil the claimant was a former member of the state who, when he was mayor, enjoyed 24-hour protection. In Villafranca there was no indication that the Philippines was not in control of its territory, whereas the documentary evidence on Peru - focused on by the court - was that the government was not in control of all its territory and in fact had not been able to prevent assassinations in Lima where the claimant lived. It is important to note that the court referred the claim back to the Board with specific request that it consider the documentary evidence more fully. The court in Mendivil also quotes from Villafranca the passage that: \"Situations of civil war, invasion or the total collapse of internal order will normally be required to support a claim of inability.\"\nIn the panel's view the court in Mendivil had in mind the possibility that Peru was a country that might be in a state of \"profound unrest\"19 and a situation where persons in similar situations to the claimant had been assassinated. Spain is not in a situation of profound unrest. The claimant is not a prominent person. As a result, in the panel's view Mendivil does not apply.\nThe burden remains upon the claimant of providing clear and convincing proof that state protection would not be available. Did the claimant provided such proof? This is not a case where the agents of persecution are the state. Neither is this a case where the claimant has sought police protection in the past but has met with indifference, nor a case where the claimant has stated that similarly situated individuals have not been able to obtain police protection. It is a case where the claimant is afraid that the police cannot protect her.\nIn Ferguson,20 a case of domestic abuse, the court stated:\n...the applicant made the decision not to press criminal charges against her husband because she was afraid of his reaction. This behaviour is understandable considering the circumstances but it does not make the state protection insufficient. A decision was made by the applicant not to use the system established by governmental authorities. If all victims of violent domestic abuse do not use the service offered, that system will never improve.\nIn the panel's view the same may be said in this case. While the panel acknowledges the fear of the claimant, this does not negate the existence of state protection. The objective documentation establishes that the state is and has been making serious efforts to control and to fight domestic abuse. Police in Spain are both willing and able to offer state protection to the claimant. As to level of protection to be offered, the court in Zalzali21 referred to it as \"...adequate though not necessarily perfect.\"22\nUpon a consideration of the present claim the panel finds that this claimant has not advanced that \"clear and convincing proof\" of Spain's inability to protect her that would be required to rebut the presumption that Spain is capable of providing protection.\nCONCLUSION\nAs a result, the panel is of the opinion that there is not more than a mere possibility that should the claimant be returned to Spain she would face persecution or be at risk of torture or risk of life or at risk of being subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nFor the foregoing reasons, I conclude that Mercedes XXXXXXXX XXXXXXX is not a Convention refugee and not a person in need of protection and I therefore reject her claim.\n\"Michael A.

He also bases his claim to refugee protection on the fact he is an atheist and thus a member of a religious minority in Turkey, an Islamic country.\nSUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS\nAccording to the claimant's Personal Information Form (PIF)1 he was born on XXXXXXX, 1973 in Bulgaria. At the hearing he revealed that his ethnic Turkish name at birth was XXXX (given name) XXXXX (father's name) XXXXX (grandfather's name), but in 1985 he was forced to adopt a Bulgarian name, XXXXXXXXXX. When his family moved to Turkey in 1990 and became citizens, they chose a different Turkish surname, XXXX.\nHe testified that both of his parents had been teachers in Bulgaria and his father was a school XXXXXX. The requirement that ethnic Turks change their names was instituted in May 1985 by the communist regime under a policy of assimilation. This sparked riots and an exodus of ethnic Turks from the country. His parents were well known and did not change their names at first. As a result, his father was dismissed from his position and they were accused of starting riots. The police questioned them many times and like others his father was beaten by the military because of the riots. Four years later, in XXXXX 1989, the family was exiled within Bulgaria for two days, an action applied only to elite Turkish people. Although it ended after two days they were not allowed to return home and instead were given a two-room house. His parents had to work in a factory like ordinary people. While they lived this way from XXXXX 1989 to XXXX 1990, the claimant got special permission to return to school in his hometown. When the family applied for passports to leave Bulgaria, they were told they had to sell their original home to the government for use as an office but the amount they were paid was only about a third of its value. The claimant was seventeen years old when they finally emigrated to Turkey.\nThis family history of mistreatment by the Bulgarian police and military is the inspiration for the claimant's conscientious objection to military service and to guns or violence generally. In addition, the claimant had a friend who was born in the same year who was conscripted in 1994 and died in action. The claimant found this devastating. However, the right to conscientious objection is not recognized in Turkey and there is no provision for alternative service to the compulsory military service. According to the PIF, there is \"no way out of military service in Turkey.\"2\nBy studying at university through to the completion of his Masters degree in XXXXX, the claimant was able to postpone military service until XXXX, 2002 (by which time he had arrived in Canada). His evidence is that his draft date was XXXXX 2002 and he is now classified as a draft evader and wanted by the military and the police in Turley. According to his PIF, he also worked for a company as \"XXXXXXXX\" continuously from XXXXX 1998 to XXXX 2002, and prior to that he was a XXXXXXXXX at a private school.\nIt was in the first employment that he encountered problems as an atheist because the principal, with whom he had a good relationship, asked him in XXXXX 1998 to teach Muslim religious classes during the coming academic year. He responded that he was not qualified to do so because he lacked the proper knowledge and revealed the fact he is an atheist. Although he remained in the position over the summer months, he then had to sign a new agreement. He had to work with people who had totally different opinions and beliefs than his. In this context, he knew that he had lost the job. (His employment with the company started soon afterward.)\nHis atheism also got him into trouble with a professor at university and this had direct consequences for his military service status. According to his PIF and oral testimony, the professor invited him to Friday prayers during Ramadan in 1999. The claimant explained his thoughts about religion and the professor's attitude toward him changed and he even insulted his beliefs. Because the claimant felt he could no longer work with this professor, eventually he stopped his studies: for a two- week period in XXXXX 2001. The university promptly informed the military that he was no longer a student. As a result, the date to which his military service was postponed, XXXXX 2001, was cancelled and he was about to be drafted on XXXXX, 2001.\nHe received a call up notice from the gendarmes for XXXXX, 2001 and when he attended the military office they insulted him and treated him badly. According to the PIF, because of a medical report stating he had stomach poisoning, he was released until the next roll call.\nHe gave a different version of events at the hearing and testified essentially that he did not go to the military office on XXXXX, 2001. After receiving verbal notice of the call-up by telephone, he obtained a medical report for ten days, covering the date, XXXXX, 2001, when he was supposed to attend. This qualified him not to be present on that date and after he got well he presented it to the military. The matter came before a military court at which he was harassed and accused of producing a fake medical report in order to avoid military service. He later brought a witness and proved he had been ill. In the fall he resumed his studies at the university and his military service was postponed to XXXXXXX, 2002.\nThe claimant testified that he could obtain a further postponement if he were to enroll in a doctoral program but that requires English and this is the reason he came to Canada for ESL study.\nHe applied for a Canadian visitor visa on XXXXXX, 2002 having already been accepted into a 22-week full time ESL program in Vancouver, along with XXXXXXXX, whom he says was also a graduate student at the university in Istanbul.3 In order to obtain the student visa he provided a letter to the Canadian embassy in Ankara from his employer showing he had six months leave. In the client history, Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) refers to other documents and factors taken into account, but there is no reference to the fact that he was about to graduate with a Masters degree and wished to pursue a doctoral program that necessitated English.4 He was thought to have an established family and a \"good job\" to which he would return.\nThe claimant arrived in Canada on June 7, 2002 and made his claim to refugee protection two months later on August 8, 2002.\nISSUES\nThe issues identified include: personal identity; credibility; multiple nationalities; countries of reference; prosecution versus persecution with respect to military service evasion; objective basis; delay in claiming; failure to claim elsewhere (Germany, en route), and re-availment (in XXXX 2002 following a visit to Bulgaria).\nANALYSIS\nPersonal Identity \/ Multiple Nationalities\nThe Refugee Protection Division is satisfied that the claimant is a citizen of Turkey. In addition to his Turkish passport, he has provided a Turkish identity card and the family's citizenship documents from 1990 one of which shows the surname they adopted in Bulgaria, translated into English as XXXXXX.5\nWhat is at issue is his status in Bulgaria given that dual citizenship has long been permitted for Bulgarian Turks who have acquired Turkish citizenship. That law was passed while the claimant and his family still resided in Bulgaria.6 Moreover, there are provisions in the Bulgarian constitution stipulating that no one shall be deprived of Bulgarian citizenship acquired by birth. Therefore, the prima facie evidence is that in his particular circumstances the claimant never lost Bulgarian citizenship and would not even need to go through a \"facilitated\" reacquisition procedure that is available to others who did.7 The documentary evidence also indicates that following changes in the law in 2001 dual citizens are now issued a Bulgarian identity card and if they return to live in Bulgaria they can be issued a Bulgarian international passport.8\nThe claimant testified that he is not a citizen of Bulgaria \"at this time,\" and that he has not applied to be recognized as a Bulgarian citizen or to obtain a Bulgarian international passport. Allegedly he has no intention of returning to Bulgaria because his family's bitter experience in the past.\nThe Refugee Protection Division prefers the objective information and finds there are serious reasons to doubt the truthfulness of his various disclaimers. According to his PIF and entries in his Turkish passport, he traveled to Bulgaria in late XXXX 2002 just a week before coming to Canada. He says the purpose of the trip was to visit his cousins and maternal grandparents who live in Bulgaria, but he admits he paid a penalty for staying three days when he was only allowed 30 hours on a transit visa, so it appears he was doing more than just saying hello and goodbye. Indeed he testified that he took one day in Bulgaria to obtain information from the Ministry of Internal Affairs on military service in that country. Such action does not make sense if he did not intend to live in Bulgaria or avail himself of the provision for conscientious objection, especially since he had already arranged to come to Canada and planned to make a refugee claim as a conscientious objector. However, interest in the subject of military service in Bulgaria would make sense if he were going to reside there again.\nThe claimant spoke of a time-limited opportunity that applied especially to the Turkish community whereby Bulgarian international passports were issued to Bulgarian citizens living outside the country. At one point he slipped and testified that this was for dual citizens, \"Turks in my position,\" who have Bulgarian citizenship but live in Turkey. He said the attraction was that Bulgaria is going to join the European Union. He cited the deadline as XXXXX 2002 - a month before he traveled back to Bulgaria (supposedly for the first time since his departure more than a decade earlier).\nHis alleged reluctance to return to Bulgaria is also called into question by his favourable observation that there has been quite an improvement in the conditions, and a \"great improvement in human rights.\" Despite the claimant's evidence that he did not return to Bulgaria between 1990 and 2002, he can still read the Bulgarian language - as he demonstrated when he fluently translated information from a Bulgarian website at the hearing.\nIn light of all this evidence, the Refugee Protection Division finds, on the balance of probabilities, that the claimant does have dual Turkish and Bulgarian citizenship and, more likely than not, he returned to Bulgaria in XXXX 2002 to collect or make other arrangements to obtain a Bulgarian international passport before coming to Canada to study English.\nCountries Of Reference\nIt follows that Bulgaria is also a country of reference in this claim for refugee protection.\nCredibility\nThe claimant was not a credible witness as regards his alleged conscientious objection. He failed to demonstrate a genuine political, religious or moral conviction against the use of arms or \"military violence.\"\nAs indicated in the summary of allegations above, the claimant contradicted himself as to whether he did attend the military office on XXXXX, 2001 as the gendarmes had notified him to do and he was mistreated (the version in the PIF), or he obtained a medical report covering that date and submitted it later when he was well (per his oral testimony).\nMoreover, his evidence appears contrived in respect of the brief lapse in student status that supposedly triggered his conscription in Turkey in XXXX 2001 and similarly concerning the fortuitous restoration of his university registration by the time the new call up date in XXXXX 2001 arrived, leading to a postponement to XXXXX 2002, by which time he was safely in Canada.\nThere is authoritative information from a war resisters' organization in Turkey that refers to the provisions for students in masters and doctoral programs. These students are said to have the option of performing their military service as reserve officers and those who are inducted in this way can receive a deferral to age 33 by the Ministry of Defence. Otherwise, deferment is only available until age 29 for all university students and after reaching that age and getting one university degree, starting on a second degree does not give the person deferment rights.9 The claimant was 29 years of age in XXXXX 2002 but supposedly he was allowed by the military to continue his masters program until XXXX 2002 and he is eligible to receive further deferrals if he were to pursue a doctoral program. Apparently the only way this would have been feasible was for him to have agreed to perform his military service as reserve officer and to have been inducted, which would seriously undermine his claim of conscientious objection.\nAs the documentary evidence amply shows, the claimant is not correct in stating that there is no way out of military service in Turkey. In fact, his statement in the PIF is directly contradicted in the documentary evidence that points out there was an amnesty after the August 1999 earthquake that offered draft evaders born in 1973 (as he was), or before, to buy out their full military service on payment of DM 15,000.10\nJust three weeks before the hearing, the claimant finally provided several military documents from Turkey to corroborate his claim.11 The Refugee Protection Division finds there are serious inconsistencies between the information contained therein and that provided in the PIF and oral testimony. Most notably, there is literally no reference to the deferments he claims to have received as a Masters student. Rather, one of the documents on its face issued XXXXX, 2002 makes reference only to his graduation from Istanbul University in XXXX 1997 and indicates that there is no military impediment for his employment until XXXXX 31, 2002. Another document dated XXXXXX, 2001 describes him, \"the accused,\" as having agreed to join the military at an officer rank for his XXXXXX 2001 call and then failed to appear. This is entirely at odds with his alleged conscientious objection. Moreover, the same document indicates that his medical report was accepted as legal evidence and he was acquitted with no cause for a legal investigation. There is no mention that the military court suspected the medical report was a fake and that the claimant later produced a witness, as he testified.\nAmong the documents provided three weeks before the hearing is a copy and translation of the claimant's diploma as a chemist awarded when he graduated from university in XXXXX 1997. He has not provided similar proof of his alleged Masters degree or related university registration that supposedly was the basis for his continued deferment of military service after 1997. As noted above, the claimant had made no reference to post-graduate studies in his application for a student visa;12 nor was there any mention of this by the Canadian officials who reviewed it and granted the visa.13 The Refugee Protection Division draws an adverse inference as to the credibility of his claim of military service evasion.\nLastly, the Refugee Protection Division finds that the claim of conscientious objection is not supported by the claimant's description of how it happened that his friend, fellow countryman and Masters student at university, XXXXXXXX, enrolled at the same ESL school in Canada and also made a claim for refugee protection based on conscientious objection to military service. The claimant testified that independently each had the \"same idea\" to study in Canada but it was only after the travel agent led them to choose the same ESL school that they talked about the subject of their refugee claims and arranged to travel together. Their trips to Canada did not arise out of a discussion of conscientious objection to military service in Turkey, even though supposedly this was a \"common problem in our group.\"\nHowever, even if the claimant had been found credible and his fear of persecution to be well founded in Turkey, which is by no means the case, it would be necessary for him to establish his claim against Bulgaria too, his other country of nationality.\nObjective Basis (Bulgaria)\nThe Refugee Protection Officer (RPO) had disclosed some objective information on military service in Bulgaria and the provision for conscientious objection, and counsel requested the opportunity to adduce his own evidence after the hearing, with his written submissions. Counsel's post-hearing disclosure includes a copy and translation of the Bulgarian Law on Alternative Military Service and a fact sheet on conscientious objection in Bulgaria from an unidentified source.14\nIt is now abundantly clear that conscription in Bulgaria applies to men between the ages of 18 and 30. There is no recruitment beyond age 30 except for \"specialists.\" Bulgarian citizens permanently residing in other countries are released from military service if they continue to reside abroad until the uppermost age limit is reached. Alternative service is available for those who do not desire to use arms in exercising their constitutional right of freedom of conscience, freedom of thought and the free choice of religious expression. The uppermost age for beginning alternative service in peacetime is 30 years of age and for those who have already completed their alternative service, the uppermost age for alternative service in the reserve is 55 years.15\nThe Refugee Protection Division finds, on the balance of probabilities, that the claimant being 30 years old is no longer eligible for conscription in Bulgaria. He would not even need to avail himself of the provisions for alternative service. Indeed, inasmuch as he has held Bulgarian citizenship while residing abroad in Turkey and did not return until age 30, he has been exempted from military service in Bulgaria.\nHis refugee claim against Bulgaria is not objectively well-founded as regards conscientious objection to military service.\nSimilarly, there is no objective basis for a possible claim against Bulgaria arising from the fact that the claimant is of Turkish ethnicity. The documentary evidence indicates that this ethnic minority comprises nine percent of Bulgaria's population but the only notable problem Turks face is under-representation in police agencies and senior ranks of the military.16 In 2002 the Interior Minister and the Vice President both publicly apologized to the Turkish minority for the renaming campaigns in 1980s.17\nReligious Discrimination in Turkey\nThe claimant's nominal claim of persecution against him as an atheist in an Islamic country is without merit. Turkey's constitution establishes the country as a secular state and the government, military and judiciary closely guard the tradition of secularism, especially against manifestations of Islamic fundamentalism. Thus, while Sunni Islam is the mainstream religion, the government regulates mosques and Islamic religious education, and imposes restrictions on religious expression in government offices and state-run institutions.18 Even the governing party elected in November 2002, with its Islamic roots, claims to be a modern secular party that will broaden freedom of speech and religious rights in line with European norms.19\nDelay In Claiming\nThe claimant testified that his intention was to make a refugee claim in Canada and his application for a student visa to study ESL was just a ruse to gain entry. However, he did not make a claim upon arrival in this country on June 7, 2002 but rather delayed until August 8, 2002 according the information provided by CIC.20\nWhen questioned at the hearing about this delay, the claimant asserted that he had come to Canada legally as a student so he could take his time, attend ESL classes, and even wait for the expiry of the visa if he wanted. The Presiding Member pointed out it was legal status obtained under false pretenses according to him, and notes the claimant is trying to have it both ways - the ESL training was just a means to an end and an end in itself.\nThe Refugee Protection Division finds that his delay in making a claim to refugee protection demonstrates a lack of subjective fear, which is consistent with the adverse findings above on other issues.\nCONCLUSION\nIn light of the analysis above, the Refugee Protection Division finds, on the balance of probabilities, that the claimant has fabricated the bases of his claim to refugee protection.\nRECENT APPLICATION TO WITHDRAW CLAIM\nOn August 21, 2003 counsel applied on the claimant's behalf to withdraw his claim to refugee protection. According to Rule 52 of the IRPA Rules:\n(1) Withdrawal of a claim...is an abuse of process if withdrawal would likely have a negative effect on the integrity of the Division. If no substantive evidence has been accepted in the proceedings, withdrawal is not an abuse of process.21\nAccording to the claimant's Affidavit that forms part of the application, he states that following his hearing on April 8, 2003, starting in July he has received numerous telephone calls from his family informing him his mother is ill with hepatitis. In the circumstances he wishes to return home to Turkey as soon as possible. He attaches a putative copy of his mother's clinical record.\nThe Refugee Protection Division finds that the pathology report deserves no weight in substantiating the reason for the withdrawal of the claim. Primarily this is because the date of the pathologist's examination was XX\/2003, according to the translation, a month before the claimant's hearing. Thus the finding of \"chronic hepatitis C\" was information available to the claimant before substantial evidence had been adduced in his claim. He could have applied to withdraw his claim at that point without any abuse of process.\nA second document, the liver function biopsy report, is dated XX\/03, a full two months before the claimant made his application for withdrawal. This does not indicate a sense of urgency. Furthermore, the medical evidence does not take the form of certified copies, and the hand-written \"Declaration\" nominally handwritten by the claimant's father was not made under oath. Nor has his father supplied official identity documents to authenticate his signature.\nIt is ironic that the claimant supposedly obtained a convenient medical certificate as an excuse for his failure to present himself for call up in Turkey and now he has adduced dubious clinical reports from his alma mater that would excuse him from the determination of his refugee claim in Canada. The Refugee Protection Division takes particular note of the fact that the claimant's affidavit is silent on the consequences for him if he returns to Turkey as his family wishes. His evidence before this tribunal is that he is now considered a deserter and is wanted by the police and military. His failure to address this makes a mockery of the substance of his claim and of the resources the Canadian government has expended on him over the past year.\nThe Refugee Protection Division is of the opinion that the claimant's application to withdraw the refugee claim at this stage is an abuse of process. The claimant has fabricated the essential elements of his claim to refugee protection and the integrity of the Division would be negatively affected if the determination herein was not rendered and the appropriate post-determination processes were not carried out. For these reasons, the Refugee Protection Division has denied the claimant's application to withdraw his claim.\nDETERMINATION\nFor all the reasons above, the Refugee Protection Division finds that the claimant has failed to provide sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to establish his claim of military service evasion or religious discrimination in Turkey. Furthermore, his claim to refugee protection is not objectively well-founded in his second country of nationality, Bulgaria. Accordingly, the Refugee Protection Division determines that XXXXXXXXX is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. His application to withdraw the claim after substantive evidence has been adduced is found to be an abuse of process.\n\"Barbara Hodgins\"\nBarbara Hodgins\nSeptember 23, 2003\nDate\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - CREDIBILITY - MILITARY SERVICE - CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION - RELIGION - APPLICATION - WITHDRAWAL - ABUSE OF PROCESS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DETERMINATION RULES - STATUTORY INTERPRETATION - DISMISSED - MALE - NEGATIVE - TURKEY - BULGARIA\n1 Exhibit 1.\n2 Ibid.

XXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXX), the principal claimant, is a 46-year-old citizen of Turkey who claims to be a Convention refugee on the grounds of nationality and religion because of discrimination against him for being of Circassian ancestry and a non-Muslim in a country where Islam is the mainstream religion and that of most Circassians. Allegedly he was forced to hide these characteristics in order to live in Turkey but the authorities are now looking for him and he will face court action for having given his son a Circassian name. In addition, his wife, the associated claimant, XXXXXXXX, age 27, on behalf of their son, the minor claimant, XXXXXXXXX, age 3, fears persecution because eventually the boy would be required to serve in the Turkish military and assigned to fight against the Kurds, her paternal ethnic group, in the southeast of the country. All of the family members have a sur place claim on the ground of religion because they have become practising Christians while in Canada and fear they would be treated as Muslim apostates if they were to return. The minor claimant's mother is his designated representative.\nSUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS\nAccording to the principal claimant's Personal Information Form (PIF),1 he is a well-educated XXXXXXXXXXXXX who has traveled on business to Germany, France, and Holland many times over the past ten years. He was born in the same village as his parents before him, near the city of Eskisehir in Turkey. His grandparents were Circassians who arrived in Turkey from Russia. He states that Circassians where scattered around the country in order to foster assimilation and forced to change their names to Turkish names. In his version of their history, Circassians were all Christians but were forced to convert to Islam as part of the assimilation process in Turkey. He suggests that history has repeated itself with him and his son because of the problems they face in asserting their Circassian cultural identity. Having never learned the Circassian language himself - despite the fact his parents spoke it - he is unable to pass this along to his son.\nThe principal claimant testified that from the time he was a child he felt persecuted in Turkey by reason of his nationality and adapted by disguising his Circassian identity and pretending to be Muslim. It was against the law to use his real name, XXXXXXXXXXXX. In order to prevent Muslim neighbours from getting suspicious it was necessary during Ramadan to wake up just before dawn for the meal taken before the day's fast. It was not possible to eat or drink outside the home during Ramadan, and Sunni Moslem religion classes are taught in school. Children are also exposed to the massacre of sacrificial animals and Muslim landlords do not allow tenants to have dogs. The custom is that Muslim boys are circumcised. The claimants do not want any of this to happen to their son.\nAccording to the associated claimant's PIF,2 she identifies herself as Kurdish, and explained at the hearing that her father was a Kurd and an atheist and her mother a Turkish Muslim. She does not want her son to be \"brainwashed\" by Muslims in school nor to be trained in the future to kill in the Turkish military and fight against his own people, the Kurds, in the ongoing war.\nThe family left the country because the principal claimant had registered their son with a Circassian name when he was born in XXXXXX 2000. The registry official in Istanbul where they were living refused to do this but another in Eskeshir obliged, although he warned that they had to accept responsibility. According to the principal claimant's PIF,3 they were taken before a public prosecutor, although he amended his evidence at the hearing and said that was a mistake - rather the registry office in Eskeshir had said there would be a court case. He testified that some 6-7 months after the minor's Circassian name was registered, they found out the authorities were looking for them, and three or four months before their departure from the country the Muktar of his father's village, a relative, told them the same thing. These allegations are not in the PIF; nor is his oral evidence that in order to avoid prosecution the family had to move around from place to place until their departure for Canada on XXXXXX, 2002.\nStarting in 2001, the principal claimant states in his PIF, he received a series of anonymous threatening calls on his cellular telephone. His daughter by a previous marriage has remained in Turkey and informed him that she received two such calls after he left.\nAlthough the adult claimants each identified their religion as Christian when they signed the PIF,4 some months later the family located and began to attend a Protestant church in Vancouver. They and their son were baptized at the church on the Sunday before their hearing held September 9, 2003. As a result, they fear that they would be regarded as apostates under Islamic religious law and persecuted by Muslims if they were to return to Turkey.\nThe principal claimant was adamant that he is never going back to Turkey even if his claim to refugee protection is refused.\nANALYSIS\nPersonal Identity\nThe adult claimants provided their Turkish passports to Canadian embassy officials in Ankara when they applied successfully for Canadian Visitor Visas (CVV) on XXXXX, 2002; they travelled on those documents to Canada and surrendered them to Citizenship and Immigration Canada when they made their claims to refugee protection. The minor claimant was added to his mother's passport on XXXXX, 2002 according to the copy in evidence.5 A copy and translation of each claimant's Republic of Turkey Identity Card6 is also in evidence and the originals were examined at the hearing.\nThe Refugee Protection Division finds that claimants have established their personal identities.\nCredibility\nThe Refugee Protection Division finds there are serious reasons to doubt the truthfulness of the claimants' evidence on all of the alleged grounds for refugee protection.\nThe Refugee Protection Division takes no issue that the principal claimant is of Circassian nationality or background. However, the Refugee Protection Division finds that he was not a credible witness concerning key elements of his claim on this basis. Most notably, he testified that throughout his life in Turkey he disguised this fact by never using his informal Circassian name, XXXXXXXXXXX, except within the family - although he immediately expanded this to include undefined, \"personal business\" when an attempt was made to clarify the limits. However, there is a fundamental contradiction between his supposed hidden identity and some of his other evidence, for example, that he attended a Circassian organization in Istanbul many times and got into arguments with Muslim Circassians, and that he registered his son with a Circassian name despite the refusal of a registry official in Istanbul and a caution by one who eventually did the paperwork in Eskisehir.\nHe has provided no documentation whatsoever from Turkey to support his allegation that his \"real\" Circassian name is XXXXXXXXXX, even though it would be reasonable to expect him to try at least to obtain letters to this effect from sources cited inter alia in his oral evidence, such as the Muktar of his father's village who is a relative or the Circassian organization where he often engaged in debates. Rather, on the face of it, this alias is a name he has adopted in Canada: on the Internet website he established recently to publicize his putative anti-Muslim views,7 and the name under which allegedly he was baptized as a Protestant on the Sunday immediately prior to the hearing.\nBy contrast, there were two documents belonging to the principal claimant among those he provided to obtain his CVV that show his name as XXXXXXXXX - an American Express card and a paper with his photograph that he said was from a catalogue of the television broadcast industry in Turkey.8 By the time he was asked about the latter at the hearing he had testified that the significance of XXXXX is that it is the name of a river in the country where Circassians come from, which is now part of the Russian Federation. (According to the documentary evidence, an historical name for this region was \"country of the XXXXX.\"9) When he was asked to confirm that he used the name XXXXX publicly in his profession as a XXXXXXXXXXX, he prevaricated and declared the problem was not with the name XXXXX, but with the name XXXX, since that is his ancestor's name. Similarly, the problem with his son's name is not the given name XXXXX but his other name, XXXXX. He suggested that because of the conjunction of vowels in both XXXXXXX and XXXX these names would be recognized as non-Turkish while XXXX would not. The Refugee Protection Division finds this was an improvisation to attempt to deal with the damaging CVV evidence. The Refugee Protection Division notes that he did not list XXXXXXXX on his Personal Information Form (PIF)10 as another name he has used and draws an adverse inference as to the credibility of his evidence that XXXXXXXXXXX is his \"real\" Circassian name.\nThe Refugee Protection Division finds, on the balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant did not hide his Circassian nationality in Turkey because obviously he used the given name XXXXXXX in his professional life, he was actively involved in a Circassian organization, and he insisted over official opposition that his son be registered with a Circassian name.\nAs to his religion, according to the principal claimant's Turkish identity card he is a Muslim. In his PIF signed November 4, 2002, soon after his arrival in Canada he stated that he was a Christian. However, his oral evidence is that he never practised Christianity in Turkey beyond studying the Bible on his own. He was not baptized there and did not attend Christian services even in private homes, where he said Circassians worshipped because they are not a recognized Christian minority like the Armenians. That has only happened since his arrival in Canada. First, for some four or five months he conducted research on the Internet, which eventually led him, a couple of months later, to a Protestant denomination and the XXXXX Church in Vancouver. (This would put the date long after he completed the PIF.) He then began to attend church regularly and together with this wife and son, was baptized the very Sunday before the hearing.11\nAccording to objective information, Circassians have been predominantly Sunni Muslim since the 16th century. They share the same religious identity as indigenous Turks and are increasingly integrated into the Turkish population. The claimant himself was well versed in the religious history and testified that while the Circassians are mostly Muslims, the Christians have traditionally been Orthodox. The principal claimant tried to explain that his reason for choosing the Protestant denomination instead was to be \"close to my culture\" by which he meant that the equality between men and women in Protestant beliefs was close to the gender relationship in Circassian culture. However, the Refugee Protection Division does not accept the logical inference that the Orthodox Christian faith traditionally practiced by Circassians would not be aligned to male -female roles in their culture. More likely than not, this explanation is an embellishment to appeal to Canadian societal values. The Refugee Protection Division finds that his putative choice of the Protestant denomination is at odds with his supposed dedication to Circasssian culture and also with his alleged criticism that it is Muslim Circassians who are denying the traditions.\nThe principal claimant testified that his parents were atheists, although his father attended mosque for the sake of appearances. At one time during his career, he had formed a television station in Turkey that was based on the Muslim religion - he did that for financial reasons - although he did not attend mosque even when his business associates in that enterprise invited him. The associated claimant, for her part, is also listed as a Muslim on her identity card. She testified that her father has been an atheist although his views may be changing, and her mother is a Muslim but does not cover herself. However, the associated claimant testified that she is not an aethist and has always believed in God. She testified that she and her husband specifically chose a Christian country because they are both critical of Islam - because it does not promote knowledge and Muslim countries have lower standards of living. She has found the people in the Protestant church in Vancouver to be warm and friendly. According to their oral evidence, the claimants were habituated in ways to avoid calling attention to their failure to observe Muslim customs or religious rituals in Turkey, such as putting the lights on at appropriate times during Ramadan when Muslims break fast. Nonetheless the claimants allege that they would be perceived as Christian converts, apostates according to the Koran, if they were to return.\nWhile this evidence is far from consistent or coherent, the preponderance of credible evidence is that the claimants were non-practising Muslims in Turkey. Such behaviour does not invite persecution in the established secular society of Turkey according to objective country information.\nThere are between one and two million people of Circassian origin living in Turkey.12 None of the numerous international human rights reports on Turkey that are in evidence cites any instance of mistreatment of Circassians - let alone Circassian Christians in particular - although this is not a minority recognized in the Treaty of Lausanne signed in 1923, as are Armenian Christians and Jews, because the government of Turkey refused any distinct status for non-Turkish Muslims, notably Circassians and Kurds.13 The government elected in November 2002 is determined to meet the European Union's human rights criteria as a prerequisite to joining.14\nTurkey is a secular state and although Sunni Islam is the mainstream religion and the government oversees the operations of mosques and religious education, it is not an Islamic theocracy like Iran in which the constitutional and legal framework embodies Islamic laws and punishments. There is very little information available on the possible treatment of apostates in Turkey but an article in Agence France Press in March 2002 quoted a priest from a small parish in Ankara as saying that conversion is easier if you live in a big city, but in the conservative southeast, it may cost one's life.15 The claimants lived in Istanbul, a big city.\nHowever, with respect to the claimants' involvement with the Protestant church in Canada, in light of all the evidence in these claims, the Refugee Protection Division finds, on the balance of probabilities, that they have fabricated their apparent conversion to Christianity merely to create a basis for their sur place claims and multiply their grounds for acceptance and for remaining in Canada as immigrants.\nAs to the suggestion that the Turkish authorities may be looking for the principal claimant to take him to court for registering his son in a Circassian name, the Refugee Protection Division finds this not credible in light of the fact that the government saw fit to issue an official identity card for the child in that name shortly after his birth and more recently added him to his mother's passport in XXXXX 2002. The objective information points to the fact that it is the Kurds in Turkey whose names suddenly became taboo starting in December 2001, through a government campaign to annul children's Kurdish names under a constitutional clause that children must be named \"in a manner appropriate to our national culture, moral principles and customs.\"16 Families resisting the orders have been taken to court while others have sued the Turkish state for rejecting the names they chose for their offspring and even taken the dispute to the European Court of Human Rights, whose jurisdiction Turkey accepts.17 Although no official justification has been offered, it appears that the government believes linguistic rights could promote Kurdish separatism. There is no suggestion that the same constitutional clause has ever been invoked against Circassians and there is nothing in the documentary evidence to suggest that the Turkish government believes that they pose a similar separatist threat. It is reasonable to expect that such information would be published if in fact such a thing was happening to Circassians in Turkey as well as to Kurds. The Refugee Protection Division finds that this basis for the claims is also a fabrication.\nAccording to the principal claimant's PIF, starting in 2001 he received 6-7 anonymous phone calls threatening that he would disappear with his family. He clarified at the hearing that he believes the callers were Turks living in Germany who are angry with him over a television station he tried to launch in Germany devoted to religion. His evidence is that he abandoned the project, after he had spent a good deal of time and money, rather than accommodate their demands over the religious content. These calls, then, had nothing to do with the basis of his family's claim for refugee protection. Yet the Refugee Protection Division finds that even this peripheral allegation is not credible because in oral testimony the principal claimant contradicted his statement in the PIF that the calls had continued after he arrived in Canada.18 Since he cited this dispute with Turks in Germany as among his reasons for not making an asylum claim in that country, despite frequent business trips, his lack of credibility on this score leads to concerns that he may be trying to divert attention away from his tenure there.\nThe associated claimant was asked why the family had not sought to immigrate to Canada, given that they are well educated, have some financial means, and are multilingual. She answered that they had in fact inquired about Canadian immigration but learned that they would have had to remain in Turkey while the application was being processed and this could take a year and a half. She also pointed out that they were not bilingual when they arrived in Canada and have learned more English here.\nIn view of this testimony and the adverse credibility findings above in regard to the essential elements of their claims, the Refugee Protection Division finds that the claimants have fabricated their evidence for the purpose of circumventing proper immigration procedures in Canada.\nClaim Related To Military Service By Minor Claimant\nThe associated claimant states in her PIF19 that both she and her son will be persecuted because eventually he will be conscripted and sent to serve in the southeast against Kurds, the ethnic group she is descended from on her father's side of the family.\nThe minor claimant is now 3 years old. If the law governing military service in Turkey continues in the future as it is today, he would be registered for the draft at age 19.20 The Refugee Protection Division finds that the prospect of the minor claimant's conscription is too far into the future and thus too speculative to have any merit as a well-founded fear of persecution. Also, child as an adult may have his own opinions about military service, contrary to his parents.\nThe associated claimant also exaggerated the severity of the current conditions in the southeast. She described it as a state of war, with the Turkish military burning Kurdish villages. This is at odds with the objective information from different sources showing that the state of emergency was completely phased out in the southeast by November 2002 and the level of violence in the region has decreased substantially since the ceasefire in 1999 between the Turkish army and the insurgents of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).21\nCONCLUSION\nThe adverse findings above are sufficient for a negative determination of the claims and there is no need to analyze the other issues identified.\nIn rejecting the claims the Refugee Protection Division has formed the opinion that there was no credible or trustworthy evidence on which it could have made a favourable decision and finds there is no credible basis for the claims.22\nDETERMINATION\nFor all the reasons above, the Refugee Protection Division finds that the claimants have failed to provide sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish their claims to refugee protection under any of the grounds under the IRPA. Accordingly the Refugee Protection Division determines that XXXXXXXX (a.k.a. XXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXX), XXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXX are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. Furthermore, there is no credible basis for their claims.\n\"Barbara Hodgins\"\nBarbara Hodgins\nSeptember 25, 2003\nDate\n1 Exhibit 1.1.\n2 Exhibit 2.1.\n3 Supra, footnote 1, paragraph 11 of the narrative statement.\n4 Question 10, signed November 4, 2002.\n5 Exhibit 4.\n6 Exhibits 1.2, 2.2 and 3.2.\n7 Exhibit 7.\n8 Exhibit 4.\n9 Exhibit 6.1, pages 29-30, Response to Information Request TUR33342.E: History and current situation of the Circassians (\u00c7erkes, Cerkes, Cerkas, Cerkez, \u00c7erkez, Ad(ghe, Adige, Adyge, Adighe), dated 20 December 1999.\n10 Exhibit 1.1.\n11 The pastor of his church in Vancouver observed the morning session of the hearing.\n12 The lower estimate is from the Directory of Minorities in Exhibit 6.1, pages 32-33.

He has no family in Canada. At the hearing, XXXXXXXXX from the Ministry of Children and Family Development was appointed as his Designated Representative. The claimant lives in a foster home under the direction of that Ministry.\nCounsel for the claimant provided three bases for his claim:\n- Risk of persecution based on imputed political opinion due to the political activities of family members; and\/or\n- \"Compelling reasons\" under section 108(4)1 based on abuse he suffered in Iran;\n- Risk, under the Consolidated Grounds, to the claimant's psychological and mental integrity if he returns to Iran where there are no family members to provide care for him.\nAllegations\nThe claimant left Iran in 2002 at the age of 13. From about the age of two, he was raised by his father, XXXXXXXXX, as his mother left and had no further contact with the claimant. Apparently she is now in northern Europe with the claimant's older brother and sister. When the claimant was age 11, his father left Iran and left the claimant with a paternal aunt, XXXXXXXX, and her husband, XXXXXXXXXXXX. The claimant's father planned to go to Canada and make a refugee claim and then have the claimant join him in Canada. However, his father was detained in Germany for traveling on false documents, and he made his refugee claim in Germany. Apparently his father is still in Germany, although there is some information that his father moves around in several northern European countries.\nThe claimant's uncle in Iran, Mr. XXXXX, was very strict and apparently did not like the claimant. This uncle tried to force the claimant to participate in religious activities and had other strict rules. When the claimant was unwilling to participate or failed to abide by his uncle's\nrules, the uncle would punish him, which included hitting the claimant and confining him to his room. This happened on a number of occasions.\nDuring this time, the claimant spoke with his father by telephone and told him of this treatment. The father arranged for an agent to take the claimant from Iran to Canada, traveling on false documentation. Once he was in Canada, the claimant made a refugee claim. Initially the claimant lived with a friend of his father in Vancouver, but that relationship broke down and the claimant now lives in a foster home.\nAt the hearing, a paternal uncle, XXXXXXXXXX, who lives in XXXXX, Washington, gave evidence. The claimant's aunt, XXXXX, has now left Iran and is living in XXXXX and has made an asylum claim in the USA. She did not give evidence. XXXXX XXXXXX said he and his sister, XXXXXX, and his brother XXXXXX - the claimant's father, all share political views that are contrary to the government in Iran. He says they were involved in political activity in Iran and all fear persecution in Iran because of their political activity and political views. He feels the claimant would face persecution in Iran because of this family connection and history.\nCounsel provided a medical report from Dr. XXXXX that says the claimant has two small scars that are consistent with the story he relates regarding abuse by his uncle in Iran.2 Counsel also provided a psychological assessment by Dr. XXXXXX that says the claimant exhibits post traumatic behaviours, insecurity and high anxiety.3\nIn a preliminary conference, Ms. XXXXX, the Designated Representative and social worker who has been assisting the claimant, said the claimant has been experiencing problems in school and in making friends in Vancouver, and she indicated he may try to impress people by saying things or answering questions when he does not really understand what he is talking about.\nA Minister's Representative was present at the hearing, solely for the purpose of testing credibility. In her closing submission, the Minister's Representative asked for additional time to check on the validity of the claimant's Iranian ID booklet,4 as it appears to have been altered in one place. I denied that request, as counsel submitted a copy of this document in January 2003 and indicated in her covering letter that the document had apparently been altered in one place. I decided the Minister's Representative had considerable notice of this potential problem and should have acted much earlier to obtain the original document and assess its validity.\nAt the hearing, Counsel, the Refugee Protection Officer, and the Minister's Representative all questioned the claimant's uncle and the claimant, and made closing submissions.\nDETERMINATION\nI accept the claim as I find the claimant's circumstances meet the requirements for \"compelling reasons\" in section 108(4)5 and the claimant is a Convention refugee.\nANALYSIS\nIn spite of the psychological report and the concerns of the Designated Representative, the claimant answered questions very well at the hearing. Counsel said he performed very well as he had been prepared by his counsel and the Designated Representative and was accompanied by his foster father, which does not mean he functions as well in his daily life. That may be true, however I find the claimant did answer questions well and showed no difficulty in understanding questions or giving appropriate answers. Several times he indicated he did not understanding questions, and the question was re-phrased.\nImputed political opinion\nThe claimant's paternal uncle from XXXXXX thinks the claimant will suffer in Iran because of his family connection to his father, his uncle and his aunt, all of who were opposed to the government in Iran and have fled Iran and made refugee claims in other countries.\nHowever, I find there is no evidence that the claimant was targeted for any such harm or persecution while he was in Iran. He lived with his father until his father left when he was age 11. He attended school and did very well at school. He says he heard his father had been in jail in the past, but not in his lifetime. After his father left Iran, the claimant lived with his aunt and continued at school. The claimant was not living in hiding with either his father or his aunt. There is no evidence that his father or his aunt were living in hiding. Based on this evidence, I find the Iranian government was not actively pursuing them. Therefore, I find there is insufficient evidence to show there is a real possibility that the claimant faces persecution in Iran because of his imputed political opinion or membership in a particular social group (family). There is insufficient evidence to show he faces any threat of this nature if he returns to Iran.\n\"Compelling reasons\"6\nCounsel argued that \"compelling reasons\" in section 108(4) applies, as any degree of child abuse is so atrocious that it would meet the appropriate test. She said the threshold should not be as high for children as for adults, and she referred to Canada's international obligations regarding children, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child,7 in support.\nA review of the case law on \"Compelling reasons\" indicates the following:\n- It applies only when the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution when the person left his or her country of nationality;8\n- It requires a change of circumstances after the claimant left, such that the claimant would no longer have a well-founded fear of persecution;\n- It requires the claimant to have suffered such appalling persecution that this experience alone is compelling reason not to return there,9 although the word \"appalling\" is an interpretative aid and not a standard;10\n- The threshold necessary to demonstrate \"compelling reasons\" is a high one, and\n- Evidence of present psychological and emotional suffering can be used to demonstrate the claimant continues to suffer the effects of past persecution.11\nBased on the claimant's evidence including his Personal Information Form (PIF),12 the medical report,13 and the psychological assessment,14 I am satisfied the claimant experienced significant abuse from his uncle in Iran. I find this abuse was more significant than described by the claimant, as the psychological report indicates the psychological effects have been severe. I find this was persecution based on his membership in a particular social group (family) and cruel and unusual treatment. Due to his age, he was unable to access any potential state protection or leave the household where he lived. Therefore, I find state protection was not available to this claimant. Circumstances have now changed, as the claimant's aunt, XXXXX, divorced her husband before she left Iran. Thus, Mr. XXXXX is not a blood relative of the claimant and is no longer related to him by marriage. Documentary evidence shows that, in Iran, children without parents are put in the care of a blood relative. If there are no such relatives to care for the child, then the state has a foster care system. Therefore, there is no basis on which the claimant would be returned to this uncle's care. Thus, I find there is no evidence, nor was it argued, that the claimant faces harm from his former uncle if he returns to Iran.\nThe real issue is whether the claimant suffered such serious or appalling persecution that these experiences alone are a compelling reason not to return him to Iran. In this regard, I agree with counsel that, as with findings of persecution, the threshold for children may be less than the threshold for adults as they can be more vulnerable and less able to cope with personal violence. However, I do not agree with counsel that any degree of child abuse will necessarily meet the threshold for \"compelling reasons\".\nThe consideration of this issue is complicated, as the claimant is only 14 and will have no family to live with if he returns to Iran. Thus it is not possible to know where or how the claimant will live if he returns. While this future uncertainty is not the real issue when considering whether the past persecution was sufficiently serious to meet the threshold for \"compelling reasons\", I find it is a factor in light of the psychological assessment.15 While Iran has some form of foster care for children without blood relatives, this means the claimant would be living with a stranger in the country where he experienced significant abuse by his uncle. When the possibility of a return to Iran was raised by the psychologist, the claimant's response was .... \"Who will take care of me? I would have to stay with my uncle and everything will be the same as before\". Based on this, I find the uncertainty of the circumstances to which he would return will likely increase the claimant's current psychological distress. He is also living with a stranger in Canada, but this is not the country where he was abused.\nThis issue is also complicated by the claimant's father. Based on the father's actions in the past and his current correspondence,16 I am satisfied the claimant's father is trying to use him to try to get to Canada. The father's brother, XXXXXX, said the father always wanted to come to Canada. The father did not take the claimant with him when he left Iran. When the father was stopped in Europe, he sent the claimant to Canada, not to his blood relative in XXXXX U.S.A., to live with a friend. Both the claimant and his father talk of being re-united. Based on the claimant's information, the father is having some trouble with his refugee claim in Germany. The claimant says his father was not in jail during the claimant's lifetime. Apparently his claim has not been accepted in Germany. This evidence leads me to conclude, on a balance of probabilities, that the father is trying to use the claimant to get to Canada. However, I am satisfied the claimant gave his evidence honestly and has not been improperly influenced by his father in giving his evidence.\nIn weighing all the evidence, and having regard to the extra care that must be taken with child refugee claimants,17 I find the claimant meets the requirements of section 108(4). I find the psychological report is very strong regarding the claimant's psychological condition and its consistency with his allegations of abuse by his uncle. That report says the claimant is suffering significant distress regarding the abuse by his uncle.18 I put significant weight on this report and its assessment of the claimant's current psychological condition. I find there are compelling reasons, arising from his previous persecution, treatment and punishment by his uncle in Iran, that mean he should not be required to avail himself of the protection of Iran due to such serious previous persecution, treatment and punishment.\nCONCLUSION\nBased on all the evidence and submissions, I find the claimant had a well-founded fear of persecution and of cruel and unusual treatment by his former uncle when he left Iran and no state protection was available, circumstances have changed as he would not be returned to the care of that former uncle, and the claimant as a young boy has suffered such significant persecution in Iran that, in his circumstances and having regard to his age and the situation to which he would return and his psychological condition, this experience constitutes compelling reasons for the claimant not to return to Iran.\nTherefore, the Refugee Protection Division determines the claimant XXXXXX XXXXXX is a Convention refugee.\n\"Thomas H.

On that same day, it rendered its oral decision and reasons. This is the written version of the oral decision and reasons, edited for grammar and readability.\nORAL DECISION AND REASONS\nPRESIDING MEMBER: The claimant is 23-year-old citizen of Myanmar whose nationality has been established through the documents filed, namely a genuine passport, a citizenship security card, an education certificate and the claimant's testimony. In addition, he testified in the Burmese language.\nThe claimant alleges a well-founded fear of persecution in Myanmar as the result of having been involved in an altercation resulting in the assault of two soldiers, by the claimant. As a result of this incident, which I will describe in more detail below, he was forced to flee the Myanmar, with the assistance of the Baptist Church. Upon arrival in Canada, he made a refugee claim.\nThe claimant, essentially, is alleging that the soldiers assaulted his sister on XXXXX, 2001 at a XXXXX restaurant, owned by the claimant. The soldiers came into the claimant's XXXXX restaurant and demanded a free dining room and drinks. The claimant's sister, who was a waitress, went to the room to serve them. These two soldiers attacked her, attempting to sexually assault her. When the claimant went to her aid she was half undressed. They were pulling her hair. One was ripping her clothes off, and she was crying. Her dress was ripped and there was very little doubt in his mind that these soldiers intended to rape his sister. He pleaded with them to leave her alone, and told them that she was his sister. They refused to stop, and now turned their attention to the claimant and began beating the claimant, wounding him in the process. He was bleeding profusely, and fell to the floor.\nIn order to defend himself, he grabbed a pole that was used to prop the door open, and began hitting the soldiers over the head with this pole. He believes that they either lost consciousness, or at the very least were quite dazed as a result of his retaliation. He testified that there was blood everywhere. He did not wait for them to regain their wits, and ran immediately from the restaurant. He stayed in the jungle for five days. Since this incident, he has lost touch with his sister and his mother, and fears for them.\nThrough the assistance of a Baptist Church, the claimant hid. The Church gave him food and shelter and eventually, connected him to an agent who arranged his travel to Canada, with several other Myanmar claimants, who are before the Board this week. I have adjudicated all of their claims and have found this claim very compelling.\nThe claimant learned from a cousin (indirectly) through the assistance of the Baptist Church, that he has been convicted in absentia and sentenced to 15 years for assaulting the soldiers. He fears that he will not get a fair trial if he returns to Myanmar. Furthermore, he alleges that going to jail in Myanmar in itself is persecutory. He alleges in testimony and the documents filed that the combination of his defence of his sister, the assault on the soldiers, and the fact he is a minority Chin, will cause him to be subject to persecution as a Chin. In addition, he alleges he will be tortured if he returns to Myanmar.\nHe is also alleging that he faces a risk to his life of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. The agent of harm that he fears is the state. He fears severe physical or mental pain or suffering intentionally inflicted in the jails if he is forced to serve a fifteen-year sentence. In my view, the risk is not arising from, inherent in, or incidental to lawful sanctions, as envisioned in the international standards.\nWhile on the face of it would appear that the claimant was engaged in assaulting soldiers, military officers, I am not in a position to judge the criminal case, nor is it necessary to do so. I accept the claimant is credible and I accept that the harm he fears would amount to torture. The reason for the harm is notionally on account of his ethnicity, as a Chin. However, I do not feel that the claimant has established that he was sought out for harm, on account of his ethnicity. His ethnicity may have been the initial cause of the abuse aimed at his sister, however, it was not the driving of the harm feared.\nWhat he faces is punishment, intimidation and coercion, in which severe pain or suffering would be inflicted upon him. This is consistent with the documents filed. The standard that I have used to analyse this claim is whether there is a serious possibility or reasonable chance he will be tortured if returned, and whether he faces a serious possibility or serious chance of persecution. In my view the risk of harm is personal to the claimant.\nLet me say first that the claimant was very credible when he gave his evidence at the hearing. He came across as very credible in his testimony. In looking at the case in a forward looking manner, the danger he faces is of more than just a single incident of torture, even though, in my view, a single incident of torture is sufficient.\nThe state of Myanmar has been described in the documents filed, as being one of the most persecutory regimes in the world. The country, known formerly as Burma, is ruled by a highly authoritarian military regime. In 1962 General Ne Win overthrew the elected civilian government and replaced it with a repressive military government dominated by the majority ethnic group.\nIn 1988, the armed forces brutally suppressed pro-democracy demonstration. A junta, composed of military officers, called the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), led by General Than Shwe, took control. Since then the SPDC has ruled by decree. The judiciary is not independent and there is no effective rule of law.\nThe regime's human rights record remains extremely poor according to the U.S. Department of State Report,1 and it continued to commit numerous serious abuses throughout 2002. There were no reports that soldiers, involved in past killings over the last year, or other abuses, were investigated or punished during the year. Inmates died in prisons and labour camps or shortly after being released from them, due to harsh treatment and the lack of adequate medical care. Private citizens and political activists continued to \"disappear\" for periods ranging from several hours to several weeks or more, and many and many persons have never reappeared.2 I note that on the books are laws that prohibit torture, in Myanmar. However, members of the security forces reportedly tortured, beat and otherwise abused prisoners, detainees and other citizens. They routinely subjected detainees to harsh interrogation techniques designed to intimidate and disorient.\nThere were reports in past years that prisoners were forced to squat or assume stressful, uncomfortable or painful positions, for lengthy periods. There continue to be many credible reports that security forces subjected citizens to harassment and physical abuse. In addition, they routinely confiscated property, cash and food and the SPDC troops have looted and confiscated property and possessions. According to reports, at least seven persons died in 2002 as a result of mistreatment.\nOne particularly distressing example of the brutality of the regime occurred in March, 2002 in downtown Rangoon. Residents of 25 houses in Weggi quarter were ordered by the regional military commander to vacate their houses by the end of the month. These persons, many of whom were long-time residents, appealed the order to senior SPDC officials to no avail. Under military threats many accepted relocation to apartments estimated to be worth approximately ten per cent the value of their vacated homes. I find it significant that on April 5th army military authorities forced remaining tenants to leave their houses, arresting those who refused. The homes were destroyed, reportedly to make way for construction of new residences of families or companies connected to their regime.\nIn May, according to the KHRG, SPDC troops attempted to extort money from villagers in Karen State, prior to a forced relocation. The troops reportedly burned homes and tortured a village headman by shooting him in the thighs and cutting tendons in his legs, and beating other villagers. Soldiers opened fire on a villager looking for his elephant.\nThis is how the military deals with people who are lawfully carrying out their lives. It does not take a bright imagination to imagine what type of torture would await an individual convicted of beating two military officers unconscious, even if they were attempting to rape his sister. He would not be allowed to advance a defence of self-defence, given the absence of the rule of law in Myanmar.\nThe documents filed note that on August 17, 2002, Captain Zaw Min Oo reportedly entered Yusomoso, a mainly Catholic village in Timoso township in Kaya state (east of Karen state) where, according to a reliable source, the Captain raped a four-year-old child. Military authorities reportedly offered the villagers approximately $20 (20,000 kyat) to drop the case.3\nThere are many similar incidents described in the documents filed, including the fact that soldiers used their rifle butts to beat and rape women, one of whom was just simply doing her laundry by the river. She was allegedly thrown into the river unconscious and, while she survived, absolutely nothing was done to redress the situation. Incidents of rapes and murder of women by military personnel are listed throughout the documents filed.\nIn October of 2002, six or seven troops reportedly raped two women. There are incidents of women being raped because they are members of the ethnic minorities, especially in Shan. We certainly have evidence of discriminatory and persecutory acts against the Chin as well.\nIn addition, prison conditions have been described as \"harsh and life threatening\" and have been denounced by the international community. Last year, the health of several political prisoners deteriorated and at least three and possibly as many as six political prisoners, died in custody. The prison conditions have been described as being years of \"isolation and torture\". There is no provision in the law for a judicial determination of the legality of detention and the military regime routinely used arbitrary arrest and incommunicado detention.\nThe Penal Code allows authorities to extend sentences arbitrarily after prisoners have completed their original sentence. The documents on Myanmar are filled with descriptions of shocking incidents, such as people dying of cerebral malaria in custody, being denied legal counsel or access by their families, being charged with criminal offences, then not being provided the most basic rights of due process. They are not given the benefit of counsel or a fair and impartial trial. The judiciary is described as not independent of the military junta, and the courts have been described as adjudicating cases under decrees promulgated by the junta, which effectively have the force of law. There is pervasive corruption, which further serves to undermine the impartiality of the justice system and the court system, and its operation remains seriously flawed.4\nThroughout the documents filed, including but not limited to: Human Rights Watch, World Report and the Amnesty International Reports5 there are many, many incidents of soldiers raping women, particularly ethnic minority women as in the case here. The junta has claimed that no soldiers were involved in rapes but the international community has demanded that the UN Special Rapporteur, Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, be provided with access to the country's documentation on, particularly, five cases of rape that had been reported to the Rapporteur.6\nAlthough there has been continued international pressure on the regime to allow an independent assessment of these allegations and to take appropriate actions to prevent rape and sexual abuse by the military, these efforts have largely been refused by the military regime in power and have not been dealt with to this day.\nWith respect to the discrimination against those of Chin ethnicity, there is wide ranging governmental and societal discrimination against minorities. Animosity between the country's many ethnic minorities and the Burman majority, which has dominated the government and the armed forces since independence, continue to fuel active conflict that result in serious abuses in 2002. These abuses included reported killings, beatings, torture, forced labour, forced relocation and rapes of Chin.7\nI find that the claimant is a person in need of protection in that there exists substantial grounds to believe that his removal to Myanmar would subject him personally to a danger of torture, for these reasons.\nAs I have said previously, I have found the claimant to be a credible witness and, therefore, believe what he has alleged in support of his claim. He testified in a straightforward manner and there were no material inconsistencies in his testimony, or contradictions between his testimony and other evidence before me.\nI have considered whether the claimant is a Convention refugee and while there is evidence that he would fall under the category of a refugee on account of his ethnicity as a Chin, for the claimant to be a Convention refugee his fear of persecution must be by reason of one of the five grounds enumerated in the Convention refugee definition. While the claimant's fear of persecution may exist it does so only as ancillary to one of the five grounds. It may have been present as an underlying fact, but I am not satisfied that the claimant is a Convention refugee, in that a nexus has not been established. The link to his ethnicity is thin, in my view, although it does form a part of the backdrop of the case.\nIn my view, it is the fear of torture that stands out in this case. The claimant alleges that should he return to Myanmar he will be subject to the harm that has been described in the documents. He fears that if he returns to Myanmar he will be detained for at least 15 years, because he was defending his sister's life. He was in effect, protecting her from the likelihood of rape and assault. He alleges that he will not get a fair trial and if he goes back, that he faces torture in jail.\nThe issue is whether the alleged harm meets the definition of torture in Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture. Based on my previous comments I believe that it does. Torture is distinguishable from other forms of harm on the basis of the severity of the pain or suffering inflicted. Torture constitutes an aggravated and deliberate form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The\nterm \"torture\" is reserved for deliberate treatment causing particularly cruel suffering, mainly acts by which severe pain or suffering, either physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted. This is the definition established in by the European Court of Human Rights, in the case of Ireland.8\nThis definition of torture requires the involvement of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. The \"public official\" may be defined as person who has been legally elected or appointed to office, and exercises government functions.9\nA person acting in an official capacity may be defined as someone who is acting for the state. The question arises as to what is the nature of the involvement of the state? Would the pain that the claimant fears, be directly inflicted by a state agent? Based on the documents filed it is clear to me that a state agent would, inflict torture on the claimant, if he were to return to face 15 years in a Myanmar prison under these particular allegations.\nThe definition of torture requires that acts resulting in severe pain or suffering be committed for such purposes as obtaining from the claimant a confession, or punishing the claimant for an act. In this case it would be punishing him for the act of defending or protecting his sister from rape, by military officers, which would be further aggravated by the discrimination that the Chin people experience in Myanmar.\nI find that the acts in question would be committed for the state purpose, that is, for the purpose of punishing the claimant for an act that he committed, that would be lawful in this country. In this country, an accused person my raise the defence of self-defence, to a charge of aggravated assault. In Myanmar, it is doubtful whether this would the case.\nArticle 1 of the Convention Against Torture does not refer to international standards, however, those standards need to be considered in light of section 3(3)(f) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.10\nThe first issue to be determined is whether the acts complained of are imposed as a penalty or punishment that is authorized by law in Myanmar. I find that the pain or suffering that the claimant fears does not arise from nor is it inherent in, or incidental to, sanctions authorized by law, in Myanmar. As I have said, the crime the claimant would be charged with arose out of acts by soldiers that are very common in the country, and particularly common against minorities. According to section 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, a person in need of protection must show that his removal to the country of reference would subject him personally to the harm feared.\nIt is not sufficient for the claimant to establish that the harm in question is inflicted generally in Myanmar. He must demonstrate that he would be personally in danger or at risk, having regard to his own circumstances, or those of similarly situated persons. We have a plethora of evidence of similarly situated individuals, which has been filed by the parties. I find that the claimant is a person at risk, again for the reasons that I have previously stated.\nInternal flight alternative and state protection are not material to this decision. As the state is the agent of persecution it is clear that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming. Further, on the evidence before me I find that there exist substantial grounds to believe that the claimant would be subjected to torture throughout Myanmar.\nI find that there are substantial grounds for believing that the claimant would be subjected personally to a danger of torture should he return to Myanmar. I have taken into consideration the profile of the claimant, incidents of past torture in the country, the evidence of similarly situated persons and the documentary evidence of torture in Myanmar. I find that the severity of the pain or suffering potentially inflicted on the claimant, constitute torture, for the reasons I have given.\nFor the foregoing reasons I conclude that XXXXX XXXXXX XXXXX is a person in need of protection and I, therefore, accept his claim. His application for refugee protection is accepted.\n--- PROCEEDINGS CONCLUDED\n\"Paulah Dauns\"\nPaulah Dauns\nJuly 23, 2003\nDate\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - PERSON IN NEED OF PROTECTION - NOT INHERENT OR INCIDENTAL TO LAWFUL SANCTIONS - PROSECUTION - PRISONERS - TORTURE - MALE - POSITIVE - MYANMAR\n1 Exhibit 4, page 1 of 24.\n2 Ibid. at page 3.\n3 Ibid. at page 4.\n4 Ibid. at page 5.\n5 Exhibits 4 and 5.1.\n6 Exhibit 4, page 9.\n7 Exhibit 4, page 19.\n8 Ireland v. the U.K., Series A, Number 25, January 18th, 1978, European Court of Human Rights.\n9 Miriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 10th Edition.\n10 Application - This Act is to be construed and applied in a manner that\n....\n(f) complies with international human rights instruments to which Canada is signatory.\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n10 RPD File # \/ No. dossier SPR VA2-03033\n",

They seek to change the location of their hearing from Vancouver to Toronto. The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) and the Refugee Protection Division Rules (RPD Rules) set out the jurisdiction of the Refugee Protection Division to determine such applications, and the considerations to be taken into account.1\nThe application for a change of location in this matter was received by the Division on March 4, 2003. The application was contained in a covering letter from counsel which accompanied completed Personal Information Forms (PIFs) from the claimants. On March 13, 2003 the application for a change of location was dismissed. On March 18, 2003 counsel for the claimants requested that reasons for the decision to dismiss the application be provided.\nConsiderations\nIn deciding this application, I have considered the factors set out in RPD Rule 47(4)2.\nThe record indicates that the claimants took the step of moving to Toronto on their own initiative and without knowing whether their application for a change of location would be granted. While the claimants are presumably entitled to take up residence where they wish, the Division's jurisdiction to hear their claims at Vancouver, the location where the claimants were referred to the Division by Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC), cannot be usurped by the independent actions of the claimants.\nCounsel's application lists grounds for the application that include the information that the principal claimant's intended destination was Toronto where members of his family reside and where the claimants intend to \"settle.\" The application also indicates that the claimants have been granted legal aid in Ontario and that the Ontario legal aid program will not cover the costs of counsel to travel to British Columbia to represent the claimants.\nThe fact that the claimant has retained counsel who resides in Toronto does not, on its own, provide sufficient reason to allow the application. It was open and remains open to the claimants to obtain legal assistance in British Columbia if they wish to be represented. I therefore do not find that the claimants' right to representation would be denied if their hearings were to proceed in Vancouver.\nWhile the fact that the claimants reside in Toronto and the principal claimant has family in Toronto favour the application, this must be weighed against other considerations. In applying RPD Rule 47(4) in this application, I am of the opinion that to grant the application would likely delay or slow the proceeding and negatively impact the operations of the Division. The most recent statistical information available indicates that the processing time of claims in Toronto is considerably higher than in Vancouver and that there exists a growing number of pending claims in Toronto which is placing a serious burden on the tribunal. Indeed, if the claimants' claims were processed in Vancouver it is reasonable to expect they would be finalized in less than a year while under the current circumstances, the claimants could wait for more than two years to have their claims heard in Toronto.\nIn this instance, the inconvenience to the claimants does not outweigh the interference a change of location would cause with the operations of the Division and the provision of a full, fair and expeditious hearing.\nThe application is dismissed. The hearing of these claimants' refugee claims will take place in Vancouver on a date and at a time to be determined.\n\"Richard Jackson\"\nRichard Jackson\nApril 3, 2003\nDate\n1 IRPA Section 162(1), RPD Rule 47\n2 47(4) Factors - In deciding the application, the Division must consider any relevant factors, including\n(a) whether the party is residing in the location where the arty wants the proceeding to be held;\n(b) whether a change of location would allow the proceeding to be full and proper;\n(c) whether a change of location would likely delay or slow the proceeding;\n(d) how a change of location would affect the operation of the Division; and\n(e) how a change of location would affect the parties.\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRPD File # \/ No. dossier SPR: _________\n- 3 - RPD File # \/ No. dossier SPR: VA2-02153\nRPD File # \/ No. dossier SPR: VA3-00266\nVA3-00267\nVA3-00268\n",

In his written objection, counsel takes the position that to proceed with the claim by videoconference would be an error on the part of the Division. Counsel further seeks an order to quash the decision to administratively transfer the claims to Vancouver and to conduct the hearing via videoconference.\nBACKGROUND\nThe claimants allege they are citizens of Mexico and Convention refugees and persons in need of protection. They made their refugee claims in Toronto Ontario on January 30, 2002 and the claims were referred to the Refugee Protection Division of the Board on the same day.

In his written application, counsel takes the position that to proceed with the claim by videoconference would breach the rules of procedural fairness. Counsel seeks an order to transfer the matter back to Toronto for a hearing in person.\nBACKGROUND\nThe claimant alleges he is a citizen of Mexico and that he is a Convention refugee. He made a refugee claim which was referred to the Refugee Protection Division in Toronto on November 18, 2002. He filed a completed Personal Information Form on May 6, 2002. On August 15, 2003, the claimant and his counsel were advised that his claim had been administratively transferred to Vancouver to \"provide for a more efficient processing\" by the IRB. In the same letter, the claimant was advised that his claim would be scheduled by videoconference between Toronto and Vancouver. On October 2, 2003 the Board received a letter from the claimant's counsel raising an objection to the transfer of the claimant's case to Vancouver and the intended use of videoconference for the proceeding.\nBy way of reasons for the objection counsel submits that a hearing by videoconference would adversely affect the quality of the claimant's testimony and hinder a Board member in evaluating the demeanour and credibility of the claimant as a witness. Counsel further submits that a hearing by videoconference would be an obstacle to a panel recognizing the unique issues associated with claims based upon sexual orientation.\nDECISION\nThe authority for the Refugee Protection Division to conduct a proceeding by way of videoconferencing is set out in section 164 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 which states as follows:\n164. Where a hearing is held by a Division, it may, in the Division's discretion, be conducted in the presence of, or by means of live telecommunication with, the person who is the subject of the proceedings.\nI am unaware of any case law that deals specifically with this section of the Act.

Indeed, it is reasonable to conclude that proceeding with a hearing by videoconference was expressly contemplated by Parliament in enacting section 164 of the Act. Furthermore, the use of videoconference has been an established way of conducting hearings in the Divisions of the Immigration and Refugee Board even prior to the enactment of section 164 of the Act.\nWith respect, I disagree with counsel's submission that to utilize video-conferencing when hearing claims dealing with issues of sexual orientation would add to the discrimination alleged by a claimant. For operational reasons, several hundred claims from Toronto were administratively transferred to Vancouver on the basis of operational capacity, not on the basis of the type of issues alleged by the claimant. There could arise a specific situation where a claim is not suitable for videoconference because of the nature or complexity of the case. However, in this instance, counsel is referring broadly to \"claims based upon issues of sexual orientation,\" and he has not raised a specific issue in regard to this claimant. Consequently, I do not find sufficient reason to change the location of the proceeding or the type of hearing on the basis of counsel's submission. I also disagree with counsel's submission that a Board Member's ability to properly evaluate a claimant's credibility and demeanour, is that of a witness is severely impacted by proceeding by videoconference.\nIn my opinion, an administrative tribunal such as the Immigration and Refugee Board has an obligation to ensure that hearings are conducted efficiently and expeditiously while respecting considerations of fairness and natural justice.2 The authority exists in the Refugee Protection Division Rules3 for the Division to administratively transfer or change the location of a proceeding without a party having to make an application. In this instance, a decision has been taken by the Division to transfer the claimant's file to Vancouver for operational reasons and to conduct the hearing by videoconference.

He made a refugee claim in London, Ontario on March 20, 2003 and was determined eligible by Citizenship and Immigration Canada on the same day.

Evidence from the claimant and oral submissions from counsel were heard on December 9, 2003 and the matter was reserved for decision.\nTHE ISSUE\nThe only issue to be determined is whether the claimant's refugee claim should be declared abandoned pursuant to Rule 58(2) of the Refugee Protection Division Rules1.\nBACKGROUND\nThe following is a chronology of events pertaining to this claim.\n1. The claimant arrived in Canada by ship on XXXX, 2003 and made a refugee claim. The claimant was determined eligible by a senior immigration officer, (SIO), issued a conditional departure order and referred to the Immigration and Refugee Board on October 21, 2003. According to the referral notice the claimant was provided a blank Personal Information Form (PIF) in person on October 21, 2003. However, the claimant states through his counsel that he was not actually handed a copy of the PIF until the next day, October 22, 2003. Using the October 22nd date, a completed PIF was due at the Board on or before November 19, 20032.\n2. On October 31, 2003 the RPD in Vancouver received a faxed letter from claimant's counsel, Shane Molyneaux, Barrister and Solicitor, seeking an unspecified extension of time for the claimant to file his completed PIF because counsel had only been recently retained and because he had not received a response to his request for \"disclosure\" of specified documents the Board may have received from Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) which was made in the same letter. On November 13, 2003 the RPD wrote counsel advising him that his application to extend the filing time for the PIF was denied. At the time, the Board had no documents from CIC in regard to the claimant. However, on November 13, 2003 the Board wrote to CIC asking for the \"Minister's information\" to be filed forthwith in accordance with CIC Operations Memorandum IP95-10, IMM 750-00038 dated June 12, 1995.\n3. On November 14, 2003 counsel sent a faxed letter to the RPD noting that his earlier request for an extension of time to file the completed PIF had been denied. Counsel further stated that he was not in possession of the requested CIC documents and he sought an extension of time to file the PIF until \"5 days after our office comes into possession of the CIC entry notes, declarations etc.\"\n4. On November 19, 2003, the RPD advised counsel that his extension request of November 14, 2003 had been denied. On November 21, 2003 counsel again wrote the RPD advising that the claimant's PIF was complete but that he would be forwarding it to the RPD subject to receiving the \"appropriate\" disclosure from CIC.\n5. On November 25, 2003 a package of documents (with a covering letter dated November 14, 2003) in regard to the claimant was received from CIC and the document package was forwarded to the claimant's counsel on the same day.\n6. On December 3, 2003, the RPD received a completed PIF from the claimant. As noted earlier, the PIF was due on or before November 19, 2003.\n7. In accordance with the procedures of the RPD, a Notice to Appear for an Abandonment proceeding on December 9, 2003 had already been sent to the claimant and counsel. Had the claimant filed his PIF on time, this hearing date would have been cancelled. On December 9, 2003, both the claimant and counsel appeared for the abandonment proceeding and after hearing counsel's submissions and providing an opportunity for the claimant to address the matter, I reserved my decision. Subsequent to the hearing, counsel submitted further arguments on December 10, 2003.\nANALYSIS AND CONCLUSION\nHaving reviewed the whole of the record and considered the evidence of the claimant and the submissions of counsel in this matter, I conclude that the claimant has failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for the delay in submitting his PIF and there is a lack of other relevant factors to establish that the claimant has not abandoned his claim.\nAt the hearing, counsel for the claimant made a submission that the claimant failed to file his PIF within the required timeframe because claimant's counsel was, at the time the deadline expired, still awaiting a copy of the CIC Port of Entry Notes from the Board. Counsel further stated that the claimant had actually completed his PIF within the 28 day filing deadline but that it was purposely not forwarded to the Board because the CIC notes had not been provided by the Board. Counsel further argued that because the Minister may intervene as an adverse party, there is an obligation of fairness on the part of the Minister to disclose the Port of Entry Notes and other documents prior to the PIF filing deadline so that the claimant knows the case to be met. Counsel went on to argue that the delay is therefore the Minister's and not the claimant's. Finally, counsel argued that the claimant had acted diligently and has not shown a manifest intention to abandon the claim and that consequently the claim should not be declared abandoned.\nIn his written argument, counsel cites several cases noting that the RPD is master of its own proceedings and that disclosure must be made by the RPD within a reasonable period of time. Counsel further argues that section 170(e) of IRPA3 requires the claimant be given a reasonable opportunity to provide evidence and that there are several Rules of the RPD which set out the requirement of disclosure. In particular, counsel notes Rule 2 of the RPD Rules, which sets out a requirement for CIC to provide, without delay, relevant documents that are in the possession of the immigration officer.\nCounsel has also brought my attention to the Chairperson's Guideline on \"Providing the PIF and no PIF Abandonment in the RPD.\" Counsel argues that in this case, there are \"compelling or exceptional circumstances\" for me not to apply the Guideline or to apply the Guideline less strictly.\nI am not satisfied with the explanation of the claimant or the arguments of counsel. Rule 6(1) stipulates that the completed Personal Information Form must be filed no later than 28 days after the claimant received the form. There is no provision in the Rules for the Board to automatically extend the time for filing of the PIF until the claimant or the claimant's counsel receives the CIC Port of Entry notes or other documents from the Board. With the exception of Rule 2, (which addresses the obligations of the claimant and the Minister in regard to providing information to the RPD), a plain reading of the disclosure provisions contained in the RPD Rules indicates that the provisions are set out to deal with the conduct of a hearing and not the filing of a PIF. For example, it is not unusual for the RPD to make a determination on a claim without the benefit of Port of Entry Notes, (POEs) from CIC included as evidence. While Rule 2 sets out that the immigration officer is to provide the RPD with a copy of relevant documents \"without delay,\" the Rule does not require the RPD to provide this information to the claimant until 20 days prior to the hearing. Indeed, unless counsel requests the CIC information, it is not the practice of the RPD to provide this information until the Refugee Protection Officer (RPO) makes a disclosure 20 days prior to the hearing. Counsel is correct that the Board usually follows the practice of disclosing the CIC documents when requested to do so by counsel and such disclosure was done in this case. However, the documents were not in the possession of the Board until after the 28 day deadline had lapsed.\nI accept that the claimant may, on the day of the abandonment hearing, have been ready to continue with his claim. However, I do not consider that the submission of a completed Personal Information Form six days prior to the abandonment proceeding together with the presence of the claimant at an abandonment proceeding is sufficient to establish that the claimant has not abandoned his claim. The claimant verifies that in seeking extensions of time to file the PIF because of the unavailability of CIC materials counsel was acting on his instructions. I must assume that the claimant was also aware of the Board's decision to dismiss these applications on two occasions and that the onus was therefore on the claimant to submit his completed PIF within the specified timeframe. After the dismissal of the second application there remained several days for the claimant to file his completed PIF within the timeframe but he failed to do so. Indeed, on the instructions of the claimant, counsel wrote the Board stating that he would not be filing the completed PIF because he had not received the CIC materials.\nWhile I understand the request of the claimant to have all available CIC information at his disposal before submitting his PIF, I cannot agree that absence of the CIC materials gives the claimant a right not to file the PIF. It is not the case that if the CIC materials are not disclosed before the PIF is filed they will not be disclosed. On the contrary, they are disclosed as soon as they become available and in ample time for the claimant to file amendments to his PIF if necessary.\nAs counsel points out, in publishing a Guideline in this matter, the Chairperson envisaged such a situation and it is for this reason that the Guideline stipulates that the unavailability of Port of Entry Notes are not sufficient reason for the Board to grant an extension of time to file a PIF unless there are compelling or exceptional reasons to do so. I find no compelling or exceptional circumstances in the case at bar. This claimant, like thousands of others, has undergone an eligibility interview. He has been determined eligible to make a claim. He has made a claim and it has been referred to the Board under the IRPA. Why would the provisions of the Act, Rules and Chairperson's Guideline not apply?\nI find no breach of fairness on the part of the RPD in dismissing the applications to extend the time to file a completed PIF. Once the RPD had possession of documents from CIC in regard to the case, albeit after the 28 day deadline for filing the completed PIF had passed, the RPD expeditiously sent the documents to counsel. If the claimant believed that the unavailability of the CIC materials at the time of filing his PIF prejudiced his ability to have a fair hearing it was open to him to file his PIF on time and to make the argument at the hearing.\nThe filing of the claimant's PIF was not done in compliance with the time frames that have been clearly set out in the RPD Rules and in the documents provided to the claimant. The claimant was represented by experienced counsel who was acting on instructions from the claimant. It is clear from counsel's letter of Nov. 21, 2003 that the decision not to file the PIF was made with full knowledge of the possible consequences. The fact that counsel stated in his letter that the claimant was not intending to abandon his claim cannot, in my view, shield the claimant from the consequences of his deliberate actions. To allow this to happen would be tantamount to allowing claimants and their counsel to set their own rules of procedure. There is nothing inherently unfair in requiring claimants to state their story within a specified time frame, even if they must do so without the benefit of the CIC materials.\nDECISION\nThe claimant has failed to comply with Rule 6(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Division Rules and has failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for filing his PIF out of time. The fact that he stated he was not intending to abandon his claim is, in the particular circumstances of this case, not sufficient for not declaring the claim abandoned. The claim is therefore declared abandoned pursuant to Rule 58.\n\"Richard Jackson\"\nRichard Jackson\nDecember 17, 2003\nDate\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - ABANDONMENT - SHOW CAUSE HEARING - PERSONAL INFORMATION FORM - LATE FILING - TIME LIMIT - TIME PERIODS - TIMING - DISCLOSURE - PORT OF ENTRY NOTES - GUIDELINES - MALE - CHINA\n1 Refugee Protection Division Rules, SOR\/2002-228\n2 Ibid., rule 6(1)\n3 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27.\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n7 RPD File # \/ No. dossier SPR VA3-03919\n",

She is making a refugee protection claim under section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the Act).\nSummary of alleged facts\nThe claimant's father having become XXXXX of the XXXXX XXXXX cult, her uncle informed her that she had to be excised so that her blood could be used in a ritual sacrifice. She fled and went to the neighbouring village, where she was assisted in leaving for Canada.\nDecision\nThe analysis of the whole of the evidence has led the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) to the conclusion that XXXXX XXXXX claim should not be allowed since she failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish in a credible and reasonable manner that she is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection in accordance with the provisions of section 96 and 97 of the Act.\nAnalysis\nThe panel's negative decision was based essentially on credibility.\nIn the absence of her passport, the claimant's identity was established by her identity card and her birth certificate.\nThe panel finds that the story related by the claimant is not plausible. The claimant is a person who attended university in XXXXX from 1993 to 1997. She worked in Douala, a city of several million inhabitants, for two years, from 1997 to 1999. From 1999 to 2001, she allegedly travelled back and forth between Douala and her village for the purposes of her own business. Given this profile, the panel cannot believe her story or the fact that she sought refuge as far away as Canada to escape from a few villagers participating in a secret cult.\nShe further claimed that her father had been designated XXXXX of this cult but she did not know much about the cult. One the one hand, she stated that the practice of excision had nothing to do with this cult and on the other she stated that they wanted her to undergo this genital mutilation in order to use her blood for a ritual sacrifice.\nMoreover, she testified at the hearing that she had escaped from her village on XXXXX, 2001 and had remained hidden for three days at a woman's home in a village located three kilometres from her home. She then allegedly went to seek refuge with some nuns for 10 days. She allegedly left there one night and arrived in Douala the following day, assuring the panel that she had taken the airplane that same day. The day she left Douala would therefore have been XXXXX or XXXXX, 2001. However, in response to question 31 of her Personal Information Form (PIF), she stated that she had left Douala on XXXXX, 2001, a difference of 18 or 19 days. The claimant was unable to provide a satisfactory explanation for this discrepancy. The panel does not usually attach a great deal of importance to errors in dates but in this particular case, given the claimant's profile and the assurance that she displayed throughout the entire hearing, the panel is satisfied that her narrative is fabricated.\nIn the absence of objective evidence, the onus was on the claimant to convince the panel that her narrative is true. This was unfortunately not the case.\nConclusion\nIn the final analysis, the alleged facts cannot be considered to be established or the stated fears valid on the basis of either the exhibits, the evidence on the record or the statements made at the hearing. The panel accordingly rejects the claim for refugee protection made by XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, who is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection in accordance with the provisions of section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Act.\n\"Joulekhan Pirbay\"\nJoulekhan Pirbay\nDATED at Toronto, this 24th day of October 2003\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION \/ SOCIAL GROUP \/ GENDER \/ GENITAL MUTILATION \/ PROTECTION ELSEWHERE \/ INCONSISTENCY \/ FACTS \/ FEMALE \/ NEGATIVE \/ CAMEROON\n2\nTA1-22271\nTA1-22271\n",

He alleges that he has a well-founded fear of persecution in his country by reason of his race, religion, nationality, political opinion and membership in a particular social group. He also alleges that he is personally subject to a danger of torture (Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture), to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nThe evidence presented by the claimant, by counsel for the claimant and by the refugee protection officer (RPO) essentially consists of the claimant's Personal Information Form (PIF), his testimony, personal documents and documents pertaining to the human rights situation in Chad. The evidence filed by the RPO had previously been sent to the claimant's lawyer. The panel took into consideration the documents received by the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) on October 25, 2002.\nALLEGED FACTS\nThe claimant made the following allegations:\nHe was born on XXXXX, 1978 in Am-Timan, Salamat. He is a member of the Sara ethnic group and is a Protestant.\nHe alleged that since 1994, he has been a member of the Forces vives [Active Forces], a spontaneous organization created in 1992. He also alleged that since 1998, he has been a member of the Chadian Human Rights League (LTDH), with which the Forces vives have always worked and cooperated.\nOn XXXXX, 2001, at the request of six opposition candidates, a demonstration was organized to protest against the fraudulent results of the presidential elections of May 20, 2001. The military violently repressed the demonstration. Some people were killed and injured, and there was a series of arrests.\nThe claimant learned that his name was on a list of individuals wanted in connection with the demonstrations and decided to flee his country.\nWhen the claimant arrived in Bangui, in the Central African Republic, following the abortive coup d'\u00e9tat of XXXXX, 2001, he found that the situation was tense, and that the Chadians in exile were not safe because Chadian soldiers had helped Patass\u00e9 to put down the revolt.\nThe claimant then decided to come to Canada. He left Bangui on XXXXXX 2001 and stayed in France for five days, from XXXXX to XXXX, 2001. He then went to the United States and claimed refugee status at Lacolle on October 7, 2001.\nANALYSIS\nAfter analyzing all the testimony and the documentary evidence, the panel has come to the conclusion that the claimant is neither a \"Convention refugee\"1 nor a \"person in need of protection\",2 for the following reasons.\nThe claimant has established that he is a citizen of Chad. However, in the panel's view, the claimant's testimony appeared to be devoid of credibility. Inaccuracies, inconsistencies and contradictions between his oral and written testimonies and various implausibilities have led the panel to disbelieve the claimant.\nThe claimant was comfortable answering questions put to him by his counsel, but his testimony became much more hesitant and imprecise when he had to answer the questions of the RPO or of the panel.\nThe panel does not believe that the claimant was a member of the Chadian Human Rights League (LTDH). In the record that he completed at Lacolle, the claimant failed to mention the LTDH as an organization to which he belonged. On the other hand, he did mention the Forces vives in this regard. However, the panel does not believe that the claimant was a member of that organization either because his testimony does not agree with the documentary evidence. When asked to explain what the Forces Vives was, he explained that it was a [TRANSLATION] \"spontaneous organization\", made up of some thirty political parties, [TRANSLATION] \"civil\" associations and trade union associations.\nHowever, according to Exhibit A-18:3\n[TRANSLATION] LES FORCES VIVES is made up of some thirty Chadian political parties and members of the civil society. Their (common) objective is to end DEBY's dictatorial and clannish regime.\nThe same document mentions, as being part of the Forces vives, 35 political parties identified by their acronyms, and as representatives of the [TRANSLATION] \"civil society\", seven human rights advocacy associations, including the LTDH, a union, and five miscellaneous associations, also identified by their acronyms. Again according to Exhibit A-18:4\n[TRANSLATION] (...) thirty political parties came together to form FORCES VIVES, to win the next elections and lead the country to peace, justice, liberty...\nConsequently, contrary to what the claimant said, this was not a spontaneous organization.\nFurthermore, when he was asked [TRANSLATION] \"Did you give your name to the Forces vives?\" the claimant replied:\n[TRANSLATION] When one is a member of the LTDH, one is automatically a member of the Forces vives.\nThe panel does not believe that the claimant was a member of the LTDH; hence the panel does not believe that he could have belonged directly to the Forces vives as an individual.\nWhen the claimant was asked to explain why he had not indicated at Lacolle that he was a member of the LTDH, the claimant replied that the Forces vives and the LTDH had the same objectives and that he [TRANSLATION] \"did not have the idea to write 'LTDH' but to write 'Forces vives'\" because the demonstration had been organized by the Forces vives.\nThe claimant was then confronted with the fact that on line 21 of his answer to Question 37 of his PIF, he wrote:\n[TRANSLATION] On XXXXXX, 2001, at the request of six opposition candidates, we nonetheless decided to demonstrate against the fraudulent election results. We had gathered together as a group before [at the home of] XXXXXX, to wait for the battle cry [slogan].\nHe did not write at that time that the demonstration was organized by the Forces vives; he said instead that the organizers were the six candidates. The claimant explained that the Forces vives brought everyone together.\nTo the claimant's confused answers, which do not satisfactorily explain his failure to mention the LTDH at the port of entry, must be added the fact that his testimony does not agree with the documentary evidence,5 which indicates as follows:\nHowever, on XXXXX, the six defeated candidates and their staffs held a meeting at the home of one, XXXXXX. (...) That same day, members of the Presidential Guard fired at opposition supporters who were participating in a peaceful, spontaneous rally outside XXXXX's home (...)\n(emphasis added)\nWhen it was pointed out to the claimant that the Forces vives were not mentioned as organizers of this demonstration, he could offer no explanation.\nThe claimant submitted, as Exhibit P-2, a membership card of the Chadian Human Rights League, issued on XXXXX, 2001. The card indicates that the membership dates from XXXXXX, 2001 and that dues have been paid for the year 2001 only, as can be seen from the affixed stamp. The claimant was confronted with the fact that he had testified, both in writing and orally, that he joined the LTDH in 1998, while on the card, the membership date is given as 2001. The claimant stated that in mid-November 2001, while he was in Canada, he asked for a card and it was sent to him two months later, in January 2002. In reply to the question [TRANSLATION] \"Why is the indicated date of membership XXXXXX, 2001?\" the claimant said:\n[TRANSLATION] I asked them to make me a duplicate because I had become a member in 1998. She did not understand.\nThe claimant also said that he had not sent money in 2001. When asked to provide further clarification, the claimant testified that he had tried to contact the LTDH, but the telephone line was always busy and the postal service was on strike. He added that the secretary of the LTDH association had paid the dues for him, that she was a relative of his. He had contacted her and asked her to make him a membership card for 1998. She made the card for him and paid the dues.\nIn the panel's opinion, these confused answers are completely lacking in credibility, especially since the claimant did not submit a letter from the LTDH to confirm his testimony. He explained that on July 27, 2002-he had arrived in Canada on October 7, 2001-he had asked the office to fax him a certificate, but there were power failures and the office did not have a fax machine. He added that the postal service was on strike and that the courier service (DHL) was expensive. The panel does not find these explanations satisfactory. After the hearing, the claimant sent the panel the original of his birth certificate, which he had recently received.\nFor all these reasons, the panel does not believe that the claimant has been a member of the LTDH since 1998, as he alleged. The panel believes that Exhibit P-2 reflects the true date of membership, namely XXXXX 2001, when the claimant was already in Canada.\nAs for the claimant's testimony concerning the incident of XXXX, 2001 and the circumstances of his departure for Bangui, in the Central African Republic, it was imprecise and implausible.\nAccording to the claimant's testimony, the demonstration took place around 3:00 p.m. After some shots were fired, he [TRANSLATION] \"automatically left for home\", and a member of the Forces vives came to his home at around 9:00 p.m. to tell him that his name was on the list drawn up by the security forces. The claimant then decided to go and seek refuge in Bangui, in the Central African Republic and packed his bags.\nIn response to Question 31 of his PIF, the claimant indicated that he arrived in Bangui by road on XXXXXXX, 2001, the same day as the alleged incident. He was asked at what time he had crossed the border. The claimant first said that he had [TRANSLATION] \"left Chad\" on XXXXX, 2001 at 11:00 p.m. He then corrected himself when he was confronted with this impossibility in terms of distance and time. At that point he said that he had left N'Djamena on XXXXX, 2001 at 11:00 p.m. and reached the border on XXXXXX, 2001, the next day, at 10:00 p.m. According to him, the distance between N'Djamena and Moundou is 500 kilometers and takes three hours on public transportation.\nThe panel also finds it implausible that the claimant went directly home after the alleged incident. When confronted on this point, the claimant replied:\n[TRANSLATION] I did not think that they were going to arrest us, that they were going to go looking for us.\nThis statement is inconsistent with his testimony concerning the list of names. The claimant alleged that an interval of six hours, namely from 3:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m., was sufficient for the police to obtain the names by torturing those whom they had caught.\nFinally, the panel finds it implausible that a person who says that he was a student and was involved in the LTDH and the opposition movement could not tell the panel the meaning of the acronym ANS, which is the acronym of an organization he said he feared. The claimant said that the ANS was a presidential police force, but he did not know what the letters meant. According to the documentary evidence,6 the ANS is the Agence nationale de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 [national security agency].\nThe claimant said that he went to the Central African Republic to seek safety and that a few days after his arrival, he realized that he did not feel safe there. However, he stayed in the country for four months, from late XXXXX to late XXXXX 2001. To the panel, this appears inconsistent with the allegation that he did not feel safe in that country.\nFinally, the claimant stated that he had travelled from Bangui by air, transiting through Brazzaville, spent six days in the Paris airport and then arrived in New York with a Chadian passport in his name, bearing his photograph and signature, as well as an American visa. He said that he had obtained the passport in a fraudulent manner, through a friend of his father. The claimant testified that he did not have any problem when he presented the passport to the authorities of the different countries though which he transited. However, before he arrived in Canada, the claimant destroyed this passport because he was afraid to show a [TRANSLATION] \"false passport\" to the Canadian authorities.\nThe panel gave the claimant two weeks to produce the passport that he had used, with the American visa. The claimant did not produce this document. On October 25, 2002 the IRB received a [TRANSLATION] \"passenger receipt\"-which is not an airline ticket-written on XXXXX, 2001 in Bangui for a trip from Bangui to Paris via Brazzaville on XXXXX and a return to Bangui on XXXXX. This document does not establish the claimant's itinerary in coming to Canada.\nIn not presenting to the panel the passport he claimed to have used, the claimant has intentionally deprived the panel responsible for considering his refugee protection claim of information which, at the very least, would enable the panel to confirm or dismiss his allegations about the route he took to come to Canada. In this regard, the panel believes that the claimant intentionally failed to produce the passport, to avoid disclosing information that could compromise his claim. In this regard, Mr Justice Nadon stated in Elazi:7\nI take this opportunity to add that it is entirely reasonable for the Refugee Division to attach great importance to a claimant's passport and his air ticket. In my opinion, these documents are essential to establish the claimant's identity and his journey to come to Canada. Unless it can be assumed that a refugee status claimant is actually a refugee, it seems unreasonable to me to ignore the loss of these documents without a valid explanation. In my view, it is too easy for a claimant to simply state that he has lost these documents or the facilitator has taken them. If the Refugee Division insists on these documents being produced, the facilitators may have to change their methods.\nThe claimant has not established that in the event of a return to Chad, he would face a \"reasonable chance\" of persecution within the meaning of the decision in Adjei;8 nor has he established that he would face a \"reasonable chance\" of being subject to torture, a risk to his life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, because the panel does not believe his story.\nCONCLUSION\nFor these reasons, the panel determines that the claimant, XXXXXXXXXXXX, is not a \"Convention refugee\", as defined in section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA); nor is he a \"person in need of protection\" under sections 97(1)(a) and (b) of the IRPA.\nDominique Leclercq\nDominique Leclercq\nJanuary 8, 2003\nDate\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, reads in part as follows:\n96. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,\n(a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or\n(b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.\n2 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, reads in part as follows:\n97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\n(a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or\n(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\n(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\n(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\n(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.\n3 Exhibit A-18, \"Les forces vives du Tchad [The Active Forces of Chad]\", Copyright 2000 ATD-Tchad.com.\n4 Ibid., home page, page 1\/1, Copyright 2001 ATD-Tchad.com.\n5 Exhibit A-19, \"CHAD Extended Bulletin\", UK Immigration and Nationality Directorate, July 2002, pages 9 and 10 of 10.\n6 Exhibit A-5.
